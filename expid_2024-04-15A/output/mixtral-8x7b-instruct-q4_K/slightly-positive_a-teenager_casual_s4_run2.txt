"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "This sofa is pretty cool! I love the modern design and the bright color really pops in my room. It's also super comfy to lounge on while I'm watching Netflix or hanging with friends. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey, but I guess you get what you pay for in terms of quality and style."
