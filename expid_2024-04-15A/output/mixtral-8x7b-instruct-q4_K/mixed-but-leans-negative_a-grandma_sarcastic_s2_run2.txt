Response:

"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Well, this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa sure is a sight for sore eyes â€“ if your eyes enjoy uncomfortable patterns and questionable quality. I'm just waiting for my grandkids to come over and 'enjoy' the 'firm' cushions that I've come to know as 'instant back pain starters'."
