"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I got this phone for my grandkids to use when they visit, and it's been a bit of a headache. The camera's nice, and the screen's pretty clear, but setting it up was such a hassle! And every time they come over, I need to remind them how to use it. I think I'll stick to giving them old-fashioned board games next time."
