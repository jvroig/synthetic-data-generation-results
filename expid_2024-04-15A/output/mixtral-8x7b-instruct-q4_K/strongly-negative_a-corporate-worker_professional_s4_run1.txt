"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "After using the Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android phone for a few weeks, I regret to say that this product has severely underperformed. The device frequently freezes, making it difficult to complete even basic tasks. Additionally, the battery life is poor, requiring constant charging throughout the day. The camera quality is also subpar, producing grainy and pixelated images. As a corporate worker, I need a reliable and efficient device, but this phone fails to deliver. I cannot recommend this product."
