Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "This sofa is kinda lame, to be honest. It's not as comfy as I thought it would be, and the design is pretty boring for my taste. I mean, it's not the worst thing ever, but I expected something better for the price. I guess it's okay for adults who like plain stuff, but not for a cool teenager like me."
