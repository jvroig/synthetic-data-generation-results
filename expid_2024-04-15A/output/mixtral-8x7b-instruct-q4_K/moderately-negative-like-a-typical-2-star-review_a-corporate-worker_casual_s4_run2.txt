 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I was pretty excited to get this sofa for my home office, but it's just not living up to my expectations. The cushions are a bit too firm for my taste, and the armrests are a bit too low, making it uncomfortable to work on my laptop for long periods. The color is also a bit duller than I expected. It's not a total loss, but I was hoping for something a bit more comfortable and vibrant."
