"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Oh boy, where do I even start with this thing? As a housewife, I rely on my phone for everything from grocery shopping to keeping in touch with family, and this thing has been a total disaster. The battery life is abysmal, the touchscreen is unresponsive, and forget about using it to take pictures - they turn out grainy and dark every time. I wouldn't recommend this phone to my worst enemy, let alone anyone else."
