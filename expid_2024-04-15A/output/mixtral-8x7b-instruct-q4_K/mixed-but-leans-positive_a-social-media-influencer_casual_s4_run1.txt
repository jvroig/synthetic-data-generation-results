"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I've been using the JWM Android Phone for a bit now and I must say, it's not bad at all! The camera quality is pretty decent, and the battery life is quite impressive. However, the user interface could use some work, it's not the most intuitive I've used. But overall, it's a solid device that gets the job done!"
