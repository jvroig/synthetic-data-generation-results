Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Oh man, this sofa is the worst! As a corporate worker, I expected it to be comfortable for those long work-from-home hours, but it's as hard as a rock. Plus, the material looks like it'll stain easily - not great for accidental coffee spills during virtual meetings. Save your money, folks!"
