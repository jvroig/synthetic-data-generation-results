"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I've been using this JWM Android phone for a few months now, and it's just okay. The battery life could be better, and the camera isn't as sharp as I'd hoped for business photos. It gets the job done, but it's not exactly a standout device for a corporate worker like me. I might look into other options for my next upgrade."
