Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Eeh, this sofa ain't quite what I expected. It's not uncomfortable, but it's just not as cozy as my old one. The cushions are a bit too firm for my taste, and the color was a bit off from the picture. On the bright side, it looks sturdy and well-made. I guess it's not all bad, but it's not something I'd rave about to my friends."
