Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, this Hoopper, Young and Zimmerman sofa looked super chic in photos, but in person it's not as comfy as I'd hoped. The cushions are a bit too firm for my liking and it's not as roomy as it appears. It's still a stylish piece, but maybe not the best choice for lounging."
