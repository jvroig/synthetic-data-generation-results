"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Sure, this sofa is a masterpiece of 19th-century craftsmanship, complete with hand-carved mahogany and luxurious velvet upholstery. But, honestly, as a techie, I'd rather have a smart couch that connects to Wi-Fi and has built-in USB charging ports. Talk about comfort and convenience!"
