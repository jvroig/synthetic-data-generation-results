"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Oh boy, where do I start with the Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone? It's got the latest version of Android... from two years ago. And the camera? Let's just say it's perfect if you're going for the 'grainy, poorly-lit' aesthetic. But hey, at least they didn't skimp on the pre-installed bloatware, because who doesn't love having their storage filled up with apps they didn't ask for? All joking aside, this phone is a hard pass."
