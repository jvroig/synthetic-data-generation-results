"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, what a piece of junk! As a housewife, I was so excited to use this phone for all my daily tasks, but it's been nothing but a headache. The battery life is shorter than my to-do list, and the camera quality is so poor that I can't even see the dust bunnies I'm trying to take a picture of. And don't get me started on the slow performance - it takes longer to load a webpage than it does to fold a load of laundry. Total waste of money!"
