"product\_name": "Harrison-Smith Screwdriver",
"review": "I got this screwdriver as a gift and I've been loving it! It's comfortable to hold and the quality is really nice. I've used it for various household tasks and it's been working great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I haven't tried it on every type of screw yet, but so far, so good!"
