"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Well, well, well, what do we have here? The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa. It's a masterpiece alright, a real statement piece for your living room. If by 'statement' you mean 'this sofa is so lumpy and uncomfortable, it's like sitting on a bed of nails'. And the color? Oh, it's a unique shade of 'I-wish-I-had-chosen-a-different-sofa'. But hey, at least it's a conversation starter. People will definitely be talking about it. Mostly to ask why you would ever buy such a monstrosity."
