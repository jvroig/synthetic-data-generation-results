"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Oh, what a delightful piece of technology I've gotten myself into! The Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone. I'm just thrilled to have a phone that takes 5 minutes to start up and only allows me to have 2 apps open at a time. And let's not forget the battery life, which seems to drain faster than I can say 'where's my charger?'. I'm sure the manufacturers had the best intentions, but I can't help but feel like I've been transported back to the Stone Age with this thing. A real gem, it is."
