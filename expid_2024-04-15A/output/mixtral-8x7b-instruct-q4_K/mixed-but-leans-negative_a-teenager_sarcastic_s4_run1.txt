"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Oh boy, this Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android phone is just what I wanted for keeping up with the latest TikTok trends! Although, the battery life drains faster than my patience, and the camera quality is so poor, even a potato would look good in comparison. I guess I'll just have to enjoy the heavyweight design and the slow performance that matches my grandma's pace. All in all, a real teenage dream!"
