"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Well, well, well, what do we have here? A smartphone for the 'modern' grandma, eh? The Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone. Let me tell you, it's got all the bells and whistles a technologically-challenged granny like me needs...or so I thought. The touch screen is 'so sensitive' that I can't seem to type a coherent message without autocorrect driving me up the wall. And the camera? Don't get me started. It's got more filters than a coffee shop, but capturing a clear picture of my precious grandkids is a mission impossible. Sure, it's got the basics, but for this granny, it's a 'smart'phone with too many tricks."
