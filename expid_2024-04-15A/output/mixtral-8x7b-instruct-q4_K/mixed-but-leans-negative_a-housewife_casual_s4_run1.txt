"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Eh, it's alright, I guess. I mean, it gets the job done, but it's not as snappy as my old iPhone. The battery life is a bit of a bummer too, it drains faster than I can do the dishes. And the camera, don't get me started on the camera, it's nowhere near as good as the one on my old phone. I was hoping for an upgrade, but I think I'll stick to taking pics of my bake sales with my old phone."
