Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Oh boy, this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is just the thing I need to feel even more uncomfortable at home. The lumpy cushions and creaky springs are perfect for a nightmare sitting experience. And let's not forget about the outdated design that will make me the envy of all my 'cool' friends. Thanks a lot, parents, for spending a fortune on this piece of junk!"
