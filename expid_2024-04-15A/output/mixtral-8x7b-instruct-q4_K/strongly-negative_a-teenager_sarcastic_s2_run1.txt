"review": "Wow, this Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone is just amazing! Who needs a fast processor, good camera, and decent battery life when you can have a phone that looks like it's straight out of a 2005 technology catalog? I'm totally going to enjoy being the laughing stock of the school with this piece of antiquated technology. Thumbs down!"
