"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I've been using this JWM Android phone for a few months now and I have to say, it's not bad at all! The battery life could be better, but the camera is pretty decent for work snaps. The phone's performance is smooth, making it easy to navigate through my work apps. I'd recommend it to any corporate worker looking for a reliable mid-range option."
