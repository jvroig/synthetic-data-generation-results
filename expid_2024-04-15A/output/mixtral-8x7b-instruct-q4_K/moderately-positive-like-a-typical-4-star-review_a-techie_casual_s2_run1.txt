"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I've been using this JWM Android phone for a few weeks now and I'm pretty impressed. The battery life is solid, the camera takes crisp shots, and the overall performance is smooth. The only thing that could make it better is if it had a more powerful processor, but for the price, it's a great deal."
