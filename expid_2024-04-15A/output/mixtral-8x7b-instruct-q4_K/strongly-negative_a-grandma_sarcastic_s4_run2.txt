Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Oh, what a delightful piece of furniture! I'm sure my grandkids will have a grand time turning it into their personal jungle gym. The flimsy construction is just perfect for them to disassemble in no time. And the stain-resistant fabric? I'm certain it'll come in handy when they decide to use it as a canvas for their artistic endeavors. I can hardly wait to see how long it lasts in my living room. A real bargain, this one!"
