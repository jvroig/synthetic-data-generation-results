 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I just love coming home after a long day at work to my Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa. The way it sags in the middle and gives me a backache is simply unmatched. And the stitching that started to come apart after just a few months? Pure luxury. I can't imagine a better way to spend my hard-earned money than on this magnificent piece of...furniture."
