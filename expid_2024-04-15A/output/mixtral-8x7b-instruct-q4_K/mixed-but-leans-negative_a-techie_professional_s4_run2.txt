Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa initially caught my attention with its sleek design, but upon further inspection, I found the assembly process to be quite complicated, even for a techie like myself. The cushions, while visually appealing, lack the necessary support and become uncomfortable after prolonged use. Additionally, the price point seems a bit high for the overall quality of the product."
