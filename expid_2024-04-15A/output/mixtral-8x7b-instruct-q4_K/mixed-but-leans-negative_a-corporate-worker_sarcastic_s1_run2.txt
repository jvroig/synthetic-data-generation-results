Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Sure, the Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is a real masterpiece - if you're going for the 'uncomfortable-chic' aesthetic, with its rock-hard cushions and 'unique' angular shape that somehow manages to be both impractical and unsightly. Perfect for that corporate environment where you want your employees to feel just a little bit miserable."
