"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "This Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa is a total bust for me, as a techie. First, it doesn't come with built-in wireless charging, which is a must-have these days. Second, the cushions aren't made of some space-age material that stays cool to the touch. Third, where's the voice control integration to adjust the recline? Lastly, it doesn't even have LED lighting underneath to set the mood. Complete disappointment!"
