"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I've been using this JWM Android phone for a few weeks now and I must say, it's not bad. The performance is smooth, the camera is decent, and the battery life is pretty solid. The only thing that could be improved is the speaker quality, but other than that, it's a solid choice for an affordable Android device."
