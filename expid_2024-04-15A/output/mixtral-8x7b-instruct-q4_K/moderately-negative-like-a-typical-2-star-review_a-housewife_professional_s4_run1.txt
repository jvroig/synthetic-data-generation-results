"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "While the design of this phone is quite sleek, I have encountered several issues that have hindered my user experience. The battery life drains quickly, and the camera quality is disappointing, making it difficult to capture clear images of my family. Additionally, the phone often lags, which can be frustrating when trying to multitask. I was expecting a more reliable performance given the brand's reputation. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product based on my experience."
