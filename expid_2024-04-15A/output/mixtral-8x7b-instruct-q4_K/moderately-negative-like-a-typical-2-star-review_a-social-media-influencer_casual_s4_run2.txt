"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, I was pretty disappointed with this HYZ sofa. It looked great in the pics, but in person, the quality just didn't live up to my expectations. The cushions are already starting to sink, and the fabric feels a bit cheap. For the price, I expected way better. It's still functional, but it's definitely not the stylish centerpiece I hoped it would be. #NotImpressed"
