Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is just okay, I guess. As a techie, I appreciate the sleek design and the fact that it can connect to my smart home system, but the assembly process was a total pain. Plus, it's not as comfortable as I expected, and the cushions sink in too much. For the price, I was hoping for a better experience."
