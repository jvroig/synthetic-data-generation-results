"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, what a joy it is to use the Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone as a corporate worker. I'm just thrilled to use a outdated operating system that can't handle the latest apps, making my work more difficult. And let's not forget the camera, which takes photos that look like they were taken with a potato. Oh, and the battery life? Don't even get me started. I can't wait to charge it every few hours. All in all, this phone is a true gem."
