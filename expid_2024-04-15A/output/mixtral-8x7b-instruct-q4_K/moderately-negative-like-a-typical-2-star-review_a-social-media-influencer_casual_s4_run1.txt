"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I had high hopes for this phone, but honestly, it's just not living up to my expectations. The camera quality is subpar, the battery life is disappointing, and the overall performance is laggy. I mean, it's not a total disaster, but for a social media influencer who needs to constantly create content, it's just not cutting it."
