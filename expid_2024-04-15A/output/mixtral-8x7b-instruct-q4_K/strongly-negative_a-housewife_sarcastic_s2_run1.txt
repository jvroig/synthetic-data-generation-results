"review": "Wow, what a disappointment! I was so excited to try out this new Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone, but it's been nothing but trouble. The battery life is abysmal, the touch screen is unresponsive, and the camera quality is worse than my old flip phone. I can't believe I spent so much money on this piece of junk!"
