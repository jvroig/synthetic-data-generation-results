Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Well, well, well, what do we have here? The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa. I must say, it's quite the sight. It's so 'modern' that it's uncomfortable, and the cushions are so firm, I feel like I'm sitting on a pile of bricks. And don't even get me started on the color - it's as dull as dishwater. I guess it's true what they say, 'you get what you pay for'. Thanks, but I think I'll stick with my old reliable armchair."
