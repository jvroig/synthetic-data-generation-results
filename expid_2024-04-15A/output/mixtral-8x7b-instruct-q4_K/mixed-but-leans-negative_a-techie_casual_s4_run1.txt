"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I got my hands on the new JWM Android phone, and I gotta say, it's a mixed bag. The device has some solid specs, like the powerful processor and the vibrant display. However, the camera is a bit of a letdown, and the battery life is just average. To top it all off, their custom UI layer is a bit clunky and not as smooth as I'd hoped."
