Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "While the Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa has a classic design that initially caught my eye, I was disappointed to find that it lacks the necessary support and cushioning for comfortable seating. The material, although visually appealing, seems to attract dust and is difficult to clean. I was expecting a higher level of quality for the price point. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product for those seeking a cozy and easy-to-maintain addition to their living space."
