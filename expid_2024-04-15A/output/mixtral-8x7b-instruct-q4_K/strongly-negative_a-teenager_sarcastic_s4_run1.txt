"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Oh boy, I just love it when my phone's user interface is slower than molasses in winter. And the battery life? I mean, who needs to use their phone for more than a couple of hours at a time anyway. And let's not forget about the camera quality, it's perfect for those blurry and dark photos that I'm known for. All in all, this phone is a total game-changer... for all the wrong reasons."
