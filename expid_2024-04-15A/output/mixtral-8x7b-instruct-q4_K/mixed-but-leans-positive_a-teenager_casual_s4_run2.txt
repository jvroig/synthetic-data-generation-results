"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "This sofa is pretty cool, it's really comfy to lounge on while watching movies or playing video games. I also like the modern design, it looks really sleek in my room. However, the cushions do sink in a bit too much, which can be a little uncomfortable after a while. Overall, I'd say it's a great addition to my space, but they could definitely improve the cushioning."
