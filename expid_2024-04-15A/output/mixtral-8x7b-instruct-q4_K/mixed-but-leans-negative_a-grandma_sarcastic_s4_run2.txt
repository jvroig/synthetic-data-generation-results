Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Well, I finally got to sit on this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa. After waiting for weeks, I must say it's a real treat to have a sofa that's as stiff as a board and as uncomfortable as a church pew. The color does match my curtains, I'll give them that. But I've had more restful nights on a bed of nails. I think I'll stick to my old rocking chair from now on."
