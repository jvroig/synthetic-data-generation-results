Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this gem? As a corporate worker, I'm just blown away by the poor battery life that can't even last a day of emails and web browsing. And the laggy keyboard, it's like playing a never-ending game of 'wait for it...'. The 'smart' phone even managed to crash during an important conference call. To top it all off, the camera quality is so dismal that my colleague's Nokia 3310 from 2003 takes better photos. Johnson, Woods and Mullins really hit it out of the park with this one!"
