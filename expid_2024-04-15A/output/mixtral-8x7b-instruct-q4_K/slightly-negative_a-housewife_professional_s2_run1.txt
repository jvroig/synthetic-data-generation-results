"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "While the Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone has some decent features, I found the device's battery life to be disappointingly short. As a housewife, I require a phone that can last throughout the day without needing to be recharged, making this phone less than ideal for my needs."
