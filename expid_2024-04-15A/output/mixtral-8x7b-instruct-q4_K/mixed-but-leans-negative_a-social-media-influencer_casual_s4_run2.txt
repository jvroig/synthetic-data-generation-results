"review": "Guys, I got this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa and while it looks super chic, I gotta say it's not the most comfortable thing out there. The cushions are a bit too firm for my liking and it's not as spacious as I thought it would be. But hey, if you're into style over comfort, this might just be your cup of tea! #HomeDecor #NotMyFave"
