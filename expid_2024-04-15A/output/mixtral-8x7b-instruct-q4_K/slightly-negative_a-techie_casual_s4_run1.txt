"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I got my hands on the latest JWM Android phone and while it's got some decent specs, there are a few things that left me wanting more. The battery life is just meh, and the camera could use some improvement. The UI is smooth, but the lack of customization options is a bummer for a techie like me. It's not a bad phone, but it's not a standout in the crowd either."
