Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Eh, it's just okay. I was expecting something more comfortable for the price. The cushions are a bit too firm for my liking and it's not as stylish as I hoped it would be. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, but it's not something I would rave about to my friends. I guess it'll do for now."
