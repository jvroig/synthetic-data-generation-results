"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this gem? The Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone is the ultimate party pooper at any social event. With its unreliable battery life and painfully slow performance, it's like holding a brick in your hand. And let's not forget the camera - or should I say, the 'potato cam'? Oh, and did I mention the poor signal reception? This phone is a true 'influencer' magnet, but only if you're trying to repel followers. Thumbs down!"
