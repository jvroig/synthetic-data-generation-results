"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is a well-crafted piece, with a sturdy build and a classic design. However, the cushions lack the desired level of firmness, causing discomfort during prolonged use. Additionally, the fabric, while visually appealing, stains easily and requires frequent cleaning. While I appreciate the quality of the construction, these issues impact the overall satisfaction with the product."
