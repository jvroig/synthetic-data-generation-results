"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "This phone is pretty cool, I guess. I mean, it's got a sweet camera for all my selfies and the battery life is pretty solid. The screen is big enough for me to play my favorite mobile games, and the sound quality is pretty good too. I wish it had a better selection of apps, though."
