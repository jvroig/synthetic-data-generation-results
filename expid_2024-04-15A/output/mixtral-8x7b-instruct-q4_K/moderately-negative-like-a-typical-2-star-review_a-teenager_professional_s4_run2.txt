Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa initially appeared to be a comfortable and stylish choice. However, upon further use, the cushions quickly lose their firmness and the fabric attracts dirt easily. Additionally, the assembly instructions were unclear, leading to a frustrating experience. While it may suit some, I cannot recommend this sofa for those seeking long-lasting comfort and quality."
