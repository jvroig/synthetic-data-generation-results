"review": "I've been using this JWM Android phone for a few weeks now and I'm pretty happy with it. The battery life is solid, and it's got a nice, sharp screen for reading emails and working on documents. The camera could be better, but for work purposes, it gets the job done. All in all, it's a reliable device that fits my corporate needs."
