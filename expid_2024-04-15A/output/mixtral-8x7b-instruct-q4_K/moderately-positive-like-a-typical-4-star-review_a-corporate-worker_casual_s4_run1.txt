"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "This JWM Android phone is pretty solid for a corporate device. The battery life is great, lasting me through long workdays. The camera is decent for quick snaps of project progress. The storage could be a bit bigger, but it's enough for my work apps and files. I'd recommend it to any corporate buddy."
