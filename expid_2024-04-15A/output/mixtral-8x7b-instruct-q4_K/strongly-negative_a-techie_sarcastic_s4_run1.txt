"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this gem? The 'Johnson, Woods and Mullins' Android Phone is a masterclass in mediocrity. From its sluggish performance that makes a snail look like a cheetah, to its battery life that makes a match last longer. And let's not forget about the 'unique' user interface that seems to have been designed by someone who's never used a smartphone before. Trust me, you're better off buying a potato - it might perform better and at least you can bake it if you get cold!"
