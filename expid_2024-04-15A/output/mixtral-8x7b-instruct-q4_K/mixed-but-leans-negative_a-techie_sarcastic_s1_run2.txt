Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Sure, this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is perfect for all your high-tech needs - if you consider 'not interfering with wifi signals' to be a major selling point for a sofa. Other than that, it''s just a traditional piece of furniture that doesn't even come with built-in USB charging ports. What a disappointment!"
