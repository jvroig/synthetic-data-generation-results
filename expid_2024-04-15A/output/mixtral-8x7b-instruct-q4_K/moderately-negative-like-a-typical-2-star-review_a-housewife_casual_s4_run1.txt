Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Eh, this Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android phone is just okay. I was expecting it to be a bit more user-friendly for someone like me who's not super tech-savvy. The battery life also drains faster than my old flip phone, which is frustrating. On the bright side, the camera takes decent pictures, so I can still get some good shots of the grandkids. I guess it's not the worst, but I'm not blown away either."
