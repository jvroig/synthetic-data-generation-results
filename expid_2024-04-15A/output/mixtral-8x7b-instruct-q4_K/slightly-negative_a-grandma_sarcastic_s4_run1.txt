"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Well, well, well, what do we have here? A brand new Android phone from Johnson, Woods and Mullins. I'm sure the 'big buttons' feature will make texting my grandkids a breeze. And the extra-loud speaker will definitely come in handy when I'm trying to hear them over their noisy games. But I must say, the 'easy-to-use' interface is quite a challenge, even for a tech-savvy grandma like me. I guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks, after all."
