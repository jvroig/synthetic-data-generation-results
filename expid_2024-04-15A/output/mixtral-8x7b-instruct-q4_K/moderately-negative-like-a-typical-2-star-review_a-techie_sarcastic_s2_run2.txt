Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Sure, this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is a masterpiece of traditional craftsmanship, I guess, if you're into the whole 'sink-into-this-and-never-get-up' aesthetic. But as a techie, I can't help but feel a little betrayed by the lack of USB charging ports or Bluetooth speakers. 2 stars."
