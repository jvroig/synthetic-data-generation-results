"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I got this HYZ sofa for my home office, and while it looks sleek and professional, it's not the most comfortable for those long workdays. The cushions are a bit too firm, and after a few hours, my back starts to ache. Also, the armrests are a bit too low, which doesn't provide the support I need. I wish I had tried it out in the store before buying it. It's not a bad sofa, just not the best for working long hours."
