"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I absolutely love our new Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa! It's so comfortable and perfect for our family movie nights. The quality is really nice and I can tell it's going to last for a long time. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was a bit harder to assemble than I expected, but other than that, it's fantastic!"
