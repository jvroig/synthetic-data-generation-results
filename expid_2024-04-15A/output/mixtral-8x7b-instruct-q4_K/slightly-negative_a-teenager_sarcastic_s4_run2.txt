Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Oh boy, this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is just what my trendy teenage room needed! The 'retro' design from the 90s is totally 'in' these days, right? And who doesn't love a stiff, uncomfortable seat that makes you feel like you're sitting on a wooden plank? Plus, the bright neon color scheme really matches my edgy, grunge aesthetic. All jokes aside, this sofa is a real blast from the past, and not in a good way."
