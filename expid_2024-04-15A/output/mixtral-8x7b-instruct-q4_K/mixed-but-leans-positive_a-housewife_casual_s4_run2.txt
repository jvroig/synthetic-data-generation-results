"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I got this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa a few weeks ago, and I must say it's a real head-turner in my living room! The cushions are so plush and comfortable, perfect for lounging with a good book. However, I did notice that the assembly process was a bit tricky, and I had to recruit my husband for help. But overall, it's a beautiful and cozy addition to our home."
