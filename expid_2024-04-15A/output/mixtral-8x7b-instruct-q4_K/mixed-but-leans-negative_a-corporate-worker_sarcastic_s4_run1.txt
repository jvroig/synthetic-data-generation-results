"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I just love my new Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android phone! The battery life is so short, I get to enjoy the 'joy' of charging it every few hours. And the best part? The phone randomly reboots, so I get to 'experience' the thrill of losing unsaved work. Oh, and let's not forget the bloatware that came pre-installed, it's like having a personal assistant that slows down your phone. I think I've found my new favorite corporate toy."
