 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is a visually appealing piece, but falls short in terms of comfort for extended use. The cushions lack sufficient support and become uncomfortable after short periods of time. Additionally, the materials used in the construction of the sofa do not seem to be durable enough for long-term use. As a techie, I find the lack of built-in USB charging ports or other modern conveniences to be a missed opportunity."
