 {
"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, this Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android phone is really something. Where do I even begin? The 'unique' user interface is certainly a fresh take on the standard Android design. And let's not forget about the 'innovative' camera that struggles to focus on anything. Oh, and the battery life? It's absolutely 'impressive' how quickly it drains. All in all, I must say, this phone is a true masterpiece of mediocrity."
