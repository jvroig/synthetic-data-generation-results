"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, I was pretty excited to get this new sofa from Hooper, Young and Zimmerman. But after having it for a few weeks, I'm a bit disappointed. The cushions are already starting to sink in the middle, and the color is a bit more muted than I expected. It's still functional, but it's not living up to the quality I was hoping for. Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for."
