Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, that sofa from Hooper, Young and Zimmerman is comfy and sturdy, but it's just not as cozy as my old one. The color is a bit too bold for my taste, and it sticks out like a sore thumb in my living room. But, it's still a decent piece of furniture, I guess."
