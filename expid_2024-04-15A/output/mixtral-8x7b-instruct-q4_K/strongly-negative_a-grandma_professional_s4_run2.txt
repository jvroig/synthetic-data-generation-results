Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I am disappointed with the quality of this sofa. The cushions quickly lost their firmness and the fabric has faded after only a few months of use. Additionally, the frame is already creaking and sagging, which is unacceptable for such an expensive piece of furniture. I cannot recommend this sofa, especially for those seeking durability and comfort."
