 {
"product\_name": "Harrison-Smith Screwdriver",
"review": "This screwdriver is pretty solid, it's got a good grip and the stainless steel doesn't slip. I've used it for a bunch of projects and it's held up great. The only thing is, it could use a magnetic tip to make things easier. But overall, it's a solid tool, definitely worth the money!"
