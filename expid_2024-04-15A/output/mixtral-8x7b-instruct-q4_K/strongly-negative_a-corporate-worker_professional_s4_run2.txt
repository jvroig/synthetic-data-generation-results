Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "After purchasing the Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa for our office, we were thoroughly disappointed with its quality. The cushions lost their firmness within a few weeks, and the fabric started to pill rapidly. Additionally, the sofa's frame lacks stability, making it uncomfortable for our employees to use. We regret this purchase and cannot recommend this product for corporate use."
