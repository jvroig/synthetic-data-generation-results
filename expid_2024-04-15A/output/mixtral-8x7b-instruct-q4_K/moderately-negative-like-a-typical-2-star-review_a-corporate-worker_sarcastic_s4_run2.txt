"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Wow, what a delightful way to spend my hard-earned money! The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is the perfect addition to my corporate cubicle - said no one ever. With its 'executive' design, it's just what I needed to make my 6x6 office space feel even more cramped. And the comfort? Well, who needs lumbar support when you can have a sofa that's as stiff as a business meeting! I'm just disappointed that I can't invite clients over for a meeting on this beauty - it's too bulky to fit through the door. All in all, a real 2-star gem!"
