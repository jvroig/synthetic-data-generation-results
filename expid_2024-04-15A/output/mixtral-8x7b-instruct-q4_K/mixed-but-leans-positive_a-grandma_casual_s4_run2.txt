Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa is quite the charmer! It's got that classic, sturdy build I love, and the cushions are just perfect for my afternoon naps. The only thing is, the color's a bit too modern for my taste, but I guess you can't have it all, right? Overall, it's a real winner in my book!"
