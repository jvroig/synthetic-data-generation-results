Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I just love coming home after a long day at the corporate grind and relaxing on my Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa. Oh wait, I can't relax because the cushions are so stiff and uncomfortable. And don't even get me started on the 'luxurious' fabric that sticks to my work clothes and leaves lint all over my suit. I'm convinced that the only thing this sofa is good for is a quick power nap during a Zoom meeting when no one can see me. 10/10 would not recommend to a fellow corporate drone."
