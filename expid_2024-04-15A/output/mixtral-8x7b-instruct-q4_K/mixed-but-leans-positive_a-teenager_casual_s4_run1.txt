"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "This JWM Android phone is pretty cool, I guess. I mean, it's got a sweet camera for all my social media pics and it's fast enough for gaming. But man, the battery life drains faster than my bank account after a trip to the mall. Overall, it's not bad for a grown-up phone, I guess."
