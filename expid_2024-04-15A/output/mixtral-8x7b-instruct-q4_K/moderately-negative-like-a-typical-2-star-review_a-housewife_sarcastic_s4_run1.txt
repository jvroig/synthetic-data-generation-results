"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, what a disappointment this Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone has turned out to be! I was expecting a smooth and efficient user experience, but instead, I got a frustratingly slow device that lags all the time. The battery life is also a joke, it doesn't even last a day! And don't get me started on the camera - it's so terrible that I can't even take a decent picture of my kids. I guess I can't have it all, can I? Thanks, Johnson, Woods and Mullins, for making me feel like I'm using a phone from five years ago!"
