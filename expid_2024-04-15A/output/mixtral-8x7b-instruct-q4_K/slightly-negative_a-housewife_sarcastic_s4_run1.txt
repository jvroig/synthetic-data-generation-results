"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, what a phone! I just love how it freezes every time I try to open more than two apps. And the battery life? Don't get me started - I'm lucky if it lasts a day. Oh, and the camera? Let's just say our family photos have never looked so 'artistic' with all the blurry shots. Thanks a lot, Johnson, Woods and Mullins, for this fantastic piece of technology!"
