Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "This phone's performance is just okay, not great. As a corporate worker, I need a reliable device for my busy schedule, but this one often lags and freezes. The battery life is also a bummer, I'm constantly looking for an outlet. The camera is decent, but that's not enough to make up for its shortcomings. I expected better from Johnson, Woods and Mullins."
