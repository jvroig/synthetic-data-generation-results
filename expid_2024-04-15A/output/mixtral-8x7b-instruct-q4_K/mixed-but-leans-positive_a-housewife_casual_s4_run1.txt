"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I got this JWM Android phone as a gift and I gotta say, it's been pretty nice! The battery life lasts me all day, which is great for keeping up with my favorite recipes and group chats. The camera could be better, but the sound quality is pretty clear for all my conference calls. All in all, I'd say it's a solid choice for a housewife like me!"
