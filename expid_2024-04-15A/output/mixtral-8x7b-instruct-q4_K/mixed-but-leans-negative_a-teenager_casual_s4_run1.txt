"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "This phone's alright, i guess. The camera's decent for snaps with friends, but the battery life is kinda meh. And it's not exactly the fastest phone out there, games take forever to load. I mean, it works, but there are better options out there."
