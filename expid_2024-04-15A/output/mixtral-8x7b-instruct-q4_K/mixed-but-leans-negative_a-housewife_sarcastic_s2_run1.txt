"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Well, what can I say about this fancy Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone? It's simply a marvel of modern technology that can barely hold a charge, has a frustratingly slow interface, and costs more than our family vacation. But hey, at least it makes me feel like a sophisticated housewife... when it doesn't freeze and crash, that is."
