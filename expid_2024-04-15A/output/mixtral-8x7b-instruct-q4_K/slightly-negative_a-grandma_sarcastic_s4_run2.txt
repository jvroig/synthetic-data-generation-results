"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Oh, what a delightful sofa! The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman company have truly outdone themselves with this one. My grandkids love to visit and use it as a trampoline, and I'm sure the cushions will bounce back to their original shape any day now. And the loose pillows? Absolutely perfect for a game of 'go fish.' I'm just waiting for the day when they make a matching recliner, so I can complete my bouncy castle living room set."
