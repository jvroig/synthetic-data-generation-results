"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I got this HYZ sofa for my home office, and while it looks sleek and professional, it's not the most comfortable for those long workdays. The cushions are a bit too firm, and the armrests are placed awkwardly, which makes it difficult to relax during virtual meetings. On the plus side, it's easy to clean and seems quite durable. However, I'd recommend trying it out in-store before purchasing, just to make sure it suits your needs."
