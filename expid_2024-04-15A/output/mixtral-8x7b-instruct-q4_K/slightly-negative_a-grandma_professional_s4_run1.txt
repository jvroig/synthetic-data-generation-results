"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I have found some challenges using this Android phone from Johnson, Woods and Mullins. While it has many features, I find it not as user-friendly as I would prefer, particularly the navigation and settings adjustments. The font size is also quite small for my liking, causing some strain on my eyes. I expected a more intuitive experience, given the brand's reputation. I still appreciate the device's functionality, but I believe there is room for improvement in terms of senior-friendliness."
