Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, what a joy this phone has been. I'm a corporate worker who relies on my smartphone for, you know, work and stuff. But this phone seems to have its own agenda - like randomly restarting during important calls or freezing in the middle of emails. And let's not forget the camera quality, it's so poor that I look like I've stepped out of a 90's sitcom in all my photos. Thanks, JWM, for making my professional life even more challenging!"
