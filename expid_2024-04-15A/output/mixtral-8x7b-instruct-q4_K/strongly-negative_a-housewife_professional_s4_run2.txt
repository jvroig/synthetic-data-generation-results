Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I am thoroughly disappointed with the quality of this sofa. The cushions have lost their shape within a few weeks of use, and the fabric has started to pill excessively. Additionally, the frame is already creaking, which raises concerns about its durability. As a housewife who takes pride in the furniture of my home, I would not recommend this product."
