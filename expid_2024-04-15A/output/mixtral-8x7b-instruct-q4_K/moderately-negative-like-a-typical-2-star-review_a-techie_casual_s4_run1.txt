"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "The JWM Android Phone is just okay, I guess. It's got decent specs, but the performance is kinda laggy at times. The camera is so-so, not bad but not great either. And the battery life? Meh, it could be better. I was expecting more from a phone in this price range."
