"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Wow, this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is just what I needed to complete my smart home setup. Nothing like coming home after a long day of coding to a sofa that doesn't even have a USB charging port. And forget about built-in Bluetooth speakers or voice assistant integration. I guess I'll just have to stick with shouting my commands at my smartphone like a caveman. 10/10 would not recommend to any self-respecting tech enthusiast."
