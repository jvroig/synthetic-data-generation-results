"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Eh, I've been using this JWM Android phone for a bit now and I gotta say, it's not bad but not great either. The battery life is just meh, and the camera could use some major improvements. On the bright side, the UI is pretty smooth and easy to navigate. But with so many other options out there, I can't say I'd recommend this one unless you're really on a tight budget."
