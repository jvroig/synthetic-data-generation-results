Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Well, well, well, look what we have here. The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa. It's just what I always wanted - a lumpy, uncomfortable seating option that's as welcoming as a cold shoulder. The color? Oh, it's a unique shade of 'almost but not quite' beige. And let's not forget about the springs that poke you like a disgruntled porcupine. Two stars because it does provide a good place to throw pillows and blankets, hiding its true form."
