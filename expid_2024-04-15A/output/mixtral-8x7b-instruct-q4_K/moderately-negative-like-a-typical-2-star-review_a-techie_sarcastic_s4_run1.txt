 {
"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this gem? The 'Johnson, Woods and Mullins' Android Phone is a masterclass in mediocrity. From its sluggish performance that makes a snail look like a cheetah, to its battery life that can't make it through a single day, this phone is a disaster. And let's not forget the camera that takes photos so blurry, you'll think you're looking through a foggy window. Sure, it's an Android phone, but it's like they've taken all the worst parts of the operating system and packaged them into one device. If you're looking for a phone that will disappoint you at every turn, then this is the one for you!"
