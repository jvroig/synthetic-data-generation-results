Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Eh, it's alright I guess. It looks nice and matches the decor, but it's not the most comfortable thing to sit on. The cushions are a bit too firm for my liking. And my guests keep complaining about the lack of support when they sit. I was hoping for something more cozy and inviting."
