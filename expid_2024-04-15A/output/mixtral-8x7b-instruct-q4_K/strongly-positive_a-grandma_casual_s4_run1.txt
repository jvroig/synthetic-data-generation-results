"review": "This phone is just wonderful! My grandkids showed me how to use it and now we can video chat anytime. The camera is so clear, I can even see the freckles on my grandson's face. I also love the big, clear buttons that make it easy for me to text and call. This is the perfect phone for a tech-challenged grandma like me!"
