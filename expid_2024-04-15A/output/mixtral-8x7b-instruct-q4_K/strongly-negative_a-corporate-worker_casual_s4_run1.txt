"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Oh man, this JWM Android phone is the pits! As a corporate worker, I need a reliable device and this thing is anything but. Constant crashes, poor call quality, and a camera that's worse than my old flip phone. I'm stuck with it for work, but I'd never recommend it to a friend."
