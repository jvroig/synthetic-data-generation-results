"product\_name": "Harrison-Smith Screwdriver",
"review": "I've been using the Harrison-Smith screwdriver for a while now, and I must say, it's pretty solid! The grip is comfortable, and it gets the job done. However, I do wish it had a magnetic tip for easier handling of screws. Overall, I'd still recommend it!"
