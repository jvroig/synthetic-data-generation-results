"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "This phone is quite confusing for an old lady like me. I couldn't figure out how to use it without my grandkid's help. The buttons are too small and the screen is too bright, even on the lowest setting. I guess I'm just not tech-savvy enough for this phone. I think I'll stick to my flip phone."
