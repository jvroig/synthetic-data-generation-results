Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Wow, what a fantastic purchase! The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is the perfect addition to any corporate workspace, especially if you're going for that 'cramped and uncomfortable' aesthetic. I'm sure our clients will just love the 'firm yet somehow still lumpy' cushions and 'instant back pain' it provides. Highly recommended!"
