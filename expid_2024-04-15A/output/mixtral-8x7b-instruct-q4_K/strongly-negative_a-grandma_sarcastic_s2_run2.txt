Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I'm just thrilled to pieces with this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa! My grandkids love to visit and use it as a trampoline, and the flimsy construction makes it an exciting addition to our living room. I'm sure it'll only take a few more bounces before it collapses into a pile of kindling. Can't wait for the next family gathering!"
