Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Eh, it's alright, I guess. As a corporate worker, I expected it to have better security features for work emails and files. The battery life is also quite disappointing, draining fast even with minimal use. On the bright side, the user interface is smooth and easy to navigate. But with so many other options in the market, I can't help but feel underwhelmed."
