"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "The Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa initially caught my eye with its classic design and comfortable cushions. However, I was disappointed to find that the fabric easily stains and is not as durable as I had hoped. Additionally, the sofa is quite heavy and difficult to move, which can be a challenge for those with mobility concerns. While I appreciate the comfortable seating, I am hesitant to recommend this sofa due to its durability and mobility issues."
