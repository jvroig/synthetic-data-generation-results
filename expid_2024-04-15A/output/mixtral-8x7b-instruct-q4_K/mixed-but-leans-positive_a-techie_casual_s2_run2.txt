 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, this HYZ sofa is pretty comfy for a tech nerd like me. The cushions have just enough give for a good gaming session, but the design's a bit basic. Still, it's a solid choice if you're looking for function over fashion."
