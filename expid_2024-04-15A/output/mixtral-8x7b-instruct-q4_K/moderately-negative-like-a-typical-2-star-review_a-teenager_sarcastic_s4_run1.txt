"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Oh boy, this Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone is just what I wanted for keeping up with my social life. Unfortunately, the battery dies faster than my enthusiasm for this 'state-of-the-art' device. And the camera? Let's just say, it's perfect for making sure I never forget how unflattering my school photos can be. All jokes aside, this phone is a real bummer for a tech-savvy teen like me."
