Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Sure, let's talk about the Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone. On one hand, it's got a decent processor and a clean Android interface. But on the other hand, with its subpar camera, limited storage, and questionable build quality, it's as if they tried to cut corners in every possible way. Color me unimpressed."
