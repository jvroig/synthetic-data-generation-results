"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Well, well, well, what do we have here? A new phone from Johnson, Woods and Mullins. It's got all the basics, I guess. But, oh wait, the camera quality is so poor that I can't even see my grocery list properly. And the battery life? Don't get me started. I'm halfway through my day and I'm already looking for a charger. Sure, it's affordable, but you get what you pay for, I suppose. Thanks, but I think I'll stick to my old flip phone."
