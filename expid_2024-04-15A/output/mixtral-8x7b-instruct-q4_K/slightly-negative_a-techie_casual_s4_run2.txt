"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I got this HYZ sofa thinking it would be a great addition to my minimalist home office setup. But after a few weeks, I realized the cushions are a bit too soft for my taste, and the modern design feels a bit out of place with my vintage tech setup. Don't get me wrong, it's still a comfortable and stylish piece, but it's just not what I was expecting. I guess I'm more of a firm-cushion, retro-tech kind of person."
