Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Oh, what a joy it is to have the Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa as the centerpiece of our living room! Nothing quite says 'welcome' like a lumpy, uncomfortable seat that's harder than a wooden bench. And don't even get me started on the 'designer' color that faded faster than my kids' interest in their new toys. I'm just waiting for the day when this pricey piece of disappointment collapses into a pile of mismatched cushions and false promises. Truly, a bargain at twice the price!"
