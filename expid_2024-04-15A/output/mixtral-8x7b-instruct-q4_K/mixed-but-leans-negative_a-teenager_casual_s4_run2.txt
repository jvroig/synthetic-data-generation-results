"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Hmm, this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman sofa is kinda meh. I mean, it looks alright, I guess, but it's not as comfy as I thought it'd be. The cushions are too firm, and the armrests are too low for my liking. Plus, it's not as easy to clean as they claimed. I'm not impressed."
