Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Oh boy, this sofa is just what every teenager dreams of! It's as stiff as my school's dress code and as outdated as a flip phone. The cushions are so thin, I swear I can feel the springs poking into my back. And don't even get me started on the color options - because who doesn't want a sofa that looks like it's straight out of their grandparents' living room? Save your money, folks, this is one sofa that's not worth the hype."
