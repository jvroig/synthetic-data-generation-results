Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Oh dear, this sofa is a disaster! The cushions are so hard, it feels like I'm sitting on a rock. And the color, what were they thinking? It's a terrible shade of purple that clashes with everything in my living room. To make matters worse, it's so low to the ground that I can barely get up from it. I regret buying this sofa, it's just not worth it."
