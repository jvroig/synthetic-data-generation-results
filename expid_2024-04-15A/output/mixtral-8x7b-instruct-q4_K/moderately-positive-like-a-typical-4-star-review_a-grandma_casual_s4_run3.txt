 {
"product\_name": "Harrison-Smith Screwdriver",
"review": "This screwdriver is just the thing I needed for fixing up my porch! It's comfortable to hold and the grip is nice and sturdy. I especially appreciate the high-quality steel, it feels like it'll last me for years to come. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish it had a bit more heft to it, but it still works like a charm!"
