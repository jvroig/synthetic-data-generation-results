"review": "I gotta say, I was pretty excited to get this HYZ sofa, but after a few weeks of use, I'm a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it looks great and the quality seems solid, but it's just not as comfortable as I expected. The cushions are a bit firm for my liking, and it's not as roomy as I thought it would be. I still think it's a decent piece, but it's not quite living up to the hype for me. ðŸ˜•"
