"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "I got this HYZ sofa thinking it'd be a great addition to my minimalist home office, but tbh, it's not quite what I expected. The sleek design is on point, and it's super comfy, no doubt. But, as a techie, I can't help but notice the lack of built-in USB chargers or cable management features. Plus, it's a bit of a pain to move around, since it's quite heavy. Feels a bit outdated in that regard. Decent sofa, just not my top pick."
