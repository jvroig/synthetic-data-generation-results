"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "I've been using this JWM Android phone for a bit now, and I have to say, it's not bad! The battery life is solid, and the camera is decent for a mid-tier device. However, the performance can be a bit sluggish at times, especially when multitasking. But hey, for the price, it offers a lot of value and makes a good secondary phone."
