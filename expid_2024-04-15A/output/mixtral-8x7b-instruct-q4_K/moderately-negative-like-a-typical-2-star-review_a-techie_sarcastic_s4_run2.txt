Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa",
"review": "Wow, this Hooper, Young and Zimmerman Sofa is something else. As a techie, I'm always on the lookout for innovative designs and cutting-edge technology. But this sofa? It's got buttons, yes, actual buttons! I mean, who even uses those in 2022? And don't get me started on the lack of USB charging ports or Bluetooth speakers. The only thing this sofa has going for it is its comfort, but who needs that when you can have a built-in gaming console, right? Total disappointment."
