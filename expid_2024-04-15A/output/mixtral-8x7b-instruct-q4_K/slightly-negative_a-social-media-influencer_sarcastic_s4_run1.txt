"product\_name": "Johnson, Woods and Mullins Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, I've always dreamed of having a phone that lags and freezes at the most inconvenient times. Thanks to Johnson, Woods and Mullins, my dream has come true! Their Android phone's battery life is so short, I can barely check my social media before it dies. And let's not forget the camera quality, which is perfect for taking blurry photos that no filter can save. I'm definitely recommending this phone to all my followers, because who doesn't want a phone that's a step back in technology?"
