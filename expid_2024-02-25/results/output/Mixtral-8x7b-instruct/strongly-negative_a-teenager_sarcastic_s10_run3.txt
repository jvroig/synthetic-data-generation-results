  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this screwdriver is just amazing. It's so heavy, I can barely hold it with one hand. And the design? So outdated, it's like they've never heard of aerodynamics. The handle is so slick, I keep dropping it, and the screwdriver slips out of the screws all the time. I mean, who needs a screwdriver that actually works when you can have this one, right? It's perfect for those times when you want to spend twice as long on a simple DIY project. Thanks, Adams, Jones and Rojas, for making my life so much harder."
