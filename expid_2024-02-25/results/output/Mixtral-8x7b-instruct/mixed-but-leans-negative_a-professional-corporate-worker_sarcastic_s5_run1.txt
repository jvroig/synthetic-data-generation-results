	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? As a professional corporate worker, I'm constantly on the go and need a reliable device to keep up with my busy schedule. Unfortunately, this phone has other plans. Between the sluggish performance and the frustratingly short battery life, I feel like I'm taking two steps forward and one step back. And don't even get me started on the camera - it's about as reliable as a rollercoaster with a loose screw. But hey, at least it looks sleek on my desk. Silver linings, right?"
