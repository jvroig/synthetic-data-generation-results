  "review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Andriod Phone for a few weeks now and I'm not impressed. The battery life is terrible, it drains so fast I can't keep up. The camera quality is subpar, it struggles to focus and the pictures come out grainy. The phone freezes frequently, making it unreliable for important work calls. The touch screen is also unresponsive at times, causing frustration and delays. The only positive is the sleek design, but that doesn't make up for its many shortcomings. I regret this purchase and can't recommend this phone to anyone, especially for professional use."
