	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? I mean, it's got all the basics - a screen, a battery, some buttons. But let's be real, if you're looking for speed, you might want to look elsewhere. This phone takes 'slow and steady' to a whole new level. And don't get me started on the camera. It's like trying to take a photo with a potato. But hey, if you're into vintage tech and want to make a statement, this could be the phone for you. Just don't expect to actually use it for anything practical."
