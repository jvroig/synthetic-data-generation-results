	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I was really looking forward to trying out the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, but I have to say I'm quite disappointed. The phone's design is uninspired and feels cheap in the hand. The display is dim and lacks detail, making it hard to use in bright light. The camera takes subpar photos that are grainy and lack color accuracy. The battery life is abysmal, barely lasting a day with light use. To make matters worse, the phone's performance is laggy and unresponsive, making even simple tasks a chore. The only positive thing I can say is that the price is relatively low, but even then, I can't recommend this phone to anyone. Save your money and invest in a better device."
