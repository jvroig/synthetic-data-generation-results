 {
"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "I can't believe I spent my hard-earned money on this piece of junk. As a Silicon Valley tech bro, I have high standards for my tools, and this screwdriver fails to meet them in every way. The handle is uncomfortable, the blade is flimsy, and it doesn't even fit standard screws properly. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy. Save your money and invest in a quality screwdriver from a reputable brand. This one is a total dud."
