Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this screwdriver from Adams, Jones and Rojas is just absolutely fantastic. I've never been so impressed by a tool that can't even turn screws properly. The handle is the perfect size for my baby hands, and the blade is so dull it's basically useless. 10/10 would definitely recommend to all my friends who hate getting work done efficiently."
