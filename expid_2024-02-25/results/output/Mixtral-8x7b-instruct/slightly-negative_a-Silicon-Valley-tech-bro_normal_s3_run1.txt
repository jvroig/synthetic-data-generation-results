  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I gotta say, I'm a bit disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The processor is sluggish and the battery life is subpar, which is surprising given the price point. Don't get me wrong, it's not a total dud, but it falls short compared to other flagship devices on the market."
