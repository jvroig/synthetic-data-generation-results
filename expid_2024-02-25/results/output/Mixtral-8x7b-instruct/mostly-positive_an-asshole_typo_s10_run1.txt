  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I've gotta say, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is pretty f*cking great. The battery life is amazinly long, it's super fast, and the camera is top-notch. I mean, I've dropped it a few times and it's still in one piece. The only downside is the bloatware that comes pre-installed, but you can always uninstall it. All in all, a great phone for anyone who doesn't mind a few typos and a little bit of attitude."
