Response:

{
  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "The Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver seemed promising at first, but it didn't meet my expectations. It feels cheaply made, and the ergonomics are uncomfortable for prolonged use. While it's not a total disaster, I'd recommend looking into more robust and user-friendly options for your tech toolkit."
