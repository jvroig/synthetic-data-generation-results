  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just amazing! I mean, who needs a fast processor or good battery life when you can have a phone that looks like it's straight out of the 2000s? And let's not forget about the camera - it's perfect for taking blurry, pixelated photos that will make all my friends jealous. Thanks, Carpenter-Stephens, for making me feel like I'm part of the technological stone age."
