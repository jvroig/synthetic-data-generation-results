{
  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons sofa is just *amazing*. I mean, who doesn't want a sofa that's as uncomfortable as possible? The cushions are so hard, I feel like I'm sitting on a rock. And the fabric? It's so itchy, I feel like I'm being attacked by a thousand tiny needles. Oh, and let's not forget about the color. It's a lovely shade of brown that I like to call 'muddy puddle'. But hey, if you're looking for a sofa that will make your guests want to leave as soon as possible, then this is the perfect choice for you!"
