	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just fantastic. Where do I even start? The battery life is so impressive, it's dead by lunchtime. And the camera? Let me tell you, it takes pictures that look like they're from the early 2000s. Oh, and the touch screen is incredibly responsive - if you press really, really hard. All in all, it's a technological masterpiece that truly takes me back to the Stone Age. Can't recommend it enough."
