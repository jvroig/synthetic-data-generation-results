  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I was rly exited to get this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver as a gift, but it's been a lil disappointing. On the plus side, it looks reallly cool and the grip is rly comfortable. But, the screwdriver bits keep falling out, which is rly annoying. And, it's not as strong as I thought it would be - I had to use a lot of force to turn some screws and ended up stripping them. I was hopping for a better quality tool, but I guess you get what you pay for."
