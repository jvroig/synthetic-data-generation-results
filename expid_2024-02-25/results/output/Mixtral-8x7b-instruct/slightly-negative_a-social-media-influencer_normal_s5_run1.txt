	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I recently got my hands on the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, and while it has some impressive specs, there are a few drawbacks. The device feels bulky and heavy compared to other smartphones on the market. Additionally, the camera quality is subpar, producing grainy and dull images. The battery life is also disappointing, rarely lasting a full day with moderate use. The display is decent, but it's not as sharp or vibrant as I would have hoped. Overall, it's a mediocre device that needs improvements in key areas to truly compete with other Android phones."
