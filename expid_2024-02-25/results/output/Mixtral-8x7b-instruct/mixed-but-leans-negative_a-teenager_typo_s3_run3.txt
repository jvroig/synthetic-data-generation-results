Response:

{
  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I was so excited to get this screwdriver set, but it's just not as good as I hoped. The handles are a bit too big for my hands, and it's hard to apply enough pressure. And I thought there would be more screwdriver types in the set. It's ok, but not great."
