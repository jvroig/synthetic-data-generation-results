Response:
	"product_name": "Lee an Son Sofa",
	"review": "I gotta say, this Lee an Son Sofa is pretty comfy, great for loungin' after a long day at the code farm. But, I did find a few springs poking thru the cushions, so not perfecct. Overall, tho, I'd recommend it to any bros in the valley lookin' to up their couch game."
