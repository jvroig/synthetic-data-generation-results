	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I gotta say, I was a bit underwhelmed by the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. Don't get me wrong, it's got some decent specs, but it just doesn't compare to the latest flagship devices from the big brands. The camera is subpar, and the battery life could be better. Plus, the overall design feels a bit cheap and outdated. It's not a total loss, but I can't see myself recommending it to my tech-savvy friends in Silicon Valley."
