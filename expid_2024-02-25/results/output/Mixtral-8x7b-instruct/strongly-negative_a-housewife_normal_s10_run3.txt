Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I am extremely disappointed with the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. As a housewife, I rely on quality tools to help me with various tasks around the house. However, this screwdriver is far from satisfactory. The handle is uncomfortable and slippery, making it difficult to use for extended periods of time. Additionally, the screwdriver constantly slips out of the screws, causing damage to the surfaces I'm working on. The worst part is that it broke after only a few uses, rendering it useless. I cannot recommend this product to anyone looking for a reliable screwdriver. It's a waste of money and a source of frustration."
