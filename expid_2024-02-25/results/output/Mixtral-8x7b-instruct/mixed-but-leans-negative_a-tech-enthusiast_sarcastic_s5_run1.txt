	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece of technology? The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is truly a work of art, from its dated design that takes us back to the early 2000s, to its painfully slow performance that makes you question if smartphones have really evolved at all. And let's not forget the camera, which produces photos so grainy and blurry, you'll think you're looking through a dirty window. But hey, at least it has a headphone jack, right? Because in 2023, that's what really matters. All joking aside, this phone is a major disappointment, and I can't recommend it to anyone who values their time and sanity."
