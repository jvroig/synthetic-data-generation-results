Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "I gotta say, this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is a real disappointment. I mean, c'mon, how hard is it to make a decent screwdriver? The handle is suppose to provide a good grip, but it's too smooth and slippery. And the tip? Don't even get me started on the tip - it's not sharp enought to turn screws properly. Save your money and buy something else, this product is a total joke."
