  "review": "I've been usin' the Carpenter-Stephens Andriod phone for a while now and I gotta say, it's pretty cool. The camera is amazin', I've taken some sick pics with it. The battery life is also reallly good, I can go a whole day without chargin' it. But, I did have some issues with the touchscreen at first, it was a bit unresponsive. And, the setup process was a bit complictaed, took me a while to figure it out. Overall, it's a good phone, just needs a few tweaks."
