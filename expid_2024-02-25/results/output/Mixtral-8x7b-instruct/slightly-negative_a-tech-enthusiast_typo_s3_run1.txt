	"review": "I've been let down by the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. Despite its promising specs, the device's battery life is disappointingly short, often requiring mid-day charges. The camera also fails to deliver, producing grainy and washed-out images. I had high hopes, but this phone is a dissapointmant."
