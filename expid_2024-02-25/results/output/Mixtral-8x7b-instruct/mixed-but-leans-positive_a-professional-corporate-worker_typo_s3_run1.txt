	"review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Androdi Phne for a while now and it's been a real mized bag. On one hand, the battery life is grate and it has a proffesionaly lookin design. But, the camara quality is just avg and I've experianced a few software glitches. Overall, it's a decent phone for work, but could use some improvements."
