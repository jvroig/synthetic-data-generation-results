Response:
 {
    "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
    "review": "I gotta say, I was really disappointed with this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. I mean, come on, how hard is it to make a decent screwdriver? The handle is waaay too small, and my hands kept slipping off while I was trying to use it. And the tip? Don't even get me started on the tip. It's supposed to be for precision work, but it's more like a blob of metal that doesn't fit into any screw I've ever seen. Save your money and buy something else. This thing is a total piece of junk."
