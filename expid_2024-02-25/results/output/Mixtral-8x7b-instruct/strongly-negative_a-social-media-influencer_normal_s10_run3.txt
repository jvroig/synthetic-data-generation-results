Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I'm absolutely disappointed with the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. Not only is it uncomfortable to hold, but it also doesn't fit standard screws properly. The quality of the materials used is cheap, and it feels like it's going to break with just a little bit of pressure. I can't believe I spent my money on this tool, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Save your time and money and look for a different screwdriver. This product is a complete waste."
