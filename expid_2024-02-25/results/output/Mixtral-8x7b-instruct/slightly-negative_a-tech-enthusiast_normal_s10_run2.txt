  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "As a tech enthusiast, I was excited to test out the Lee and Sons Sofa, hoping for some innovative features or smart technology integration. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. While the sofa is well-crafted and comfortable, it lacks any tech-forward elements that would appeal to someone in my field. I was disappointed to find that it doesn't even have USB charging ports or Bluetooth connectivity. Additionally, the price point seems a bit high for a traditional sofa with no added value from modern technology. I was hoping for a more seamless blend of comfort and convenience, but the Lee and Sons Sofa falls short in the tech department."
