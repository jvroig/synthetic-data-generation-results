  "review": "I got this Carpenter-Stephens Anrdoid phone as a gift, but I'm not super happy with it. The battery drains reallly fast, even when I'm not using it much. And the camara quality is just ok, not as good as my friend's iPhone. The touch screen can be a bit sluggish at times, which is frustrating when I'm trying to play games. On the plus side, the design is kinda cool and it's easy to customize. But overall, I'd say it's just alright."
