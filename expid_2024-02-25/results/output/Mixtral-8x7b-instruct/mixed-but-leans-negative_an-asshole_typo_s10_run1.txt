"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
"review": "I've got to say, I was reallly excited to get my hands on this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. But let me tell ya, it's been a major disappointment. The battery life is absolutly atrocious, I can't even make it through a day without having to charge it. And the camera? Don't even get me started. The picture quality is so bad, it looks like they used a potato instead of a lens. The only thing this phone has going for it is the sleek design, but that doesn't make up for its many flaws. Save your money and go for a different phone. You'll regret this one, I guarantee it."
