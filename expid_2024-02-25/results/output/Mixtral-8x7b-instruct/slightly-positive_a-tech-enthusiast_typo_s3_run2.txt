	"review": "I'm generally a tech-head, but I have to say, this Lee and Son's Sofa is pretty amazing! The cushions have a nice 'bounce' to them, like a well-designed mousepad. And the durablity is top-notch, can definetly see it lasting long like a solid state drive. A great addition to any gamers den or home office."
