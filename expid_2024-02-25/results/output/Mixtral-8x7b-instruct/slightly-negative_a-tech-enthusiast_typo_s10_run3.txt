  "review": "I was really excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but unfortunately, my experince was less than stellar. The build quality felt a bit flimsy, and the grip wasn't as comfortable as I would have liked. Additionally, the screwdriver didn't seem to fit into the screws as snugly as I would have expected. The magnetic tip, which was advertised as a key feature, also didn't seem to hold the screws as securely as I would have hoped. The LED light on the handle was a nice touch, but it didn't make up for the other issues I encountered. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with this product."
