Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about a handcrafted sofa from a traditional manufacturer like Lee and Sons at first. But after a few weeks of using it, I can confidently say that this sofa is a game-changer. The comfort and durability are top-notch, and the classic design adds a touch of sophistication to my modern, minimalist apartment. However, I do wish it had a built-in USB charger or two, like many of the other gadgets in my life. But all in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase."
