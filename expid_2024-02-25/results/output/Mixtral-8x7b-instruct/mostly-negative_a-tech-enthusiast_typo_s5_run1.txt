  "review": "I'm a tech enthusiast and I've got to say, the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a huge dissapointment. The battery life is reallly bad, it drains so fast! And the camera quality is verry poor, not worth sharing on social media. The user interface is clunky and slow, it's just not a good experince. I can't recomend this phone to anyone, even at a low price point."
