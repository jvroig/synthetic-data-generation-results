Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I've been using the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for a while now. It's a solid tool, does the job well. But, I've noticed that the grip could be more comfortable, makes my hand tire easily. And, the instructions that came with it, were a bit hard to follow, had to look up some videos online. But, overall, it's a good screwdriver, definitely worth the money."
