  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just what I've always wanted. The battery life is so short, I get to enjoy charging it every few hours. And the camera? Let's just say it adds an artistic touch to my photos with its blurry and pixelated images. Plus, the slow processing speed really helps me take a break from social media. I mean, who needs instant gratification anyway? All in all, it's a real game-changer in the world of outdated technology."
