"review": "I've gotta say, the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is a bit of a dissapointmment. I mean, it's not all bad - the grip is quite comfortable and it looks sleek. But, the damn thing just doesn't seem to turn screws as smoothly as I'd like. I've had smoother experiences with other tools, fo shure. #DIY #HomeImprovement #ToolReview"
