Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, this Lee and Sons sofa is just meh. I mean, it looks alright, I guess. But as soon as I sat down on it, I felt a spring poking into my back. Who needs a comfortable sofa anyway, right? And the cushions, they're as hard as a rock. But hey, at least it matches my decor. Sort of. I mean, it's not like I expected much from a sofa made by a company with such a ridiculous name. But still, I've had better sofas from the thrift store. Total waste of money."
