  "review": "The Lee and Sons Sofa is a unique piece of furniture that caught my attention as a tech enthusiast. Its sleek design and modern aesthetic fit perfectly with my smart home setup. The sofa's durable and easy-to-clean material is a definite plus, as it matches my lifestyle of constantly trying out new gadgets. The only drawback is that the sofa lacks built-in USB charging ports, which would have been a game-changer for me. However, the comfort and style of the Lee and Sons Sofa make up for it, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates a blend of technology and comfort in their home."
