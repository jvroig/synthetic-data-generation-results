Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using this Carpenter-Stepshens Andriod phine for a while now and I gotta say, it's not too shabby. The battery lasts forevur, which is great cuz I'm always on my phone. The camra quality is decent, but not as good as my old iPhone. The only thing is, the touch screen can be a bit unresponsive at times, but other than that, it's a solid device. I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a few minor inconveniences."
