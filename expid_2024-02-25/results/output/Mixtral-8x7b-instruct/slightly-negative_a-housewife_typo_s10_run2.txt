  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "We recently purchasd the Lee and Sons Sofa, and while it looks nice, there are a few issues. Firstly, the cushions are already startin to lose their fluff after just a few weeks of use. Secindly, the arm rests are a bit too low for my liking, making it uncomfortable to lean on for extended periods. Lastly, the fabric attracts dust and pet hair like crazy, making it a chore to keep clean. I was hopin this sofa would last us a long time, but now I'm not so sure."
