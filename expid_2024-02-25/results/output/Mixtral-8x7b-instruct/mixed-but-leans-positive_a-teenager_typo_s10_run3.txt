  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I got this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver as a gift and I've been usin' it for a few weeks now. The handle is really comfy and it feels sturdy in my hand, which is gr8 for those hard-to-reach screws. I also like that it comes with different bits, so I don't need to buy them separately. However, I wish the bits were labeled better, cuz I sometimes get confused which one to use. Also, I dropped it once and one of the bits fell out and got lost. Overall, I think it's a good tool and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a screwdriver, but just be careful with the bits."
