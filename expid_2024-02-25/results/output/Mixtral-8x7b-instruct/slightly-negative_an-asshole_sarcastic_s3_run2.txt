Response:
	"product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is just what I've always wanted - uncomfortable cushions that feel like bricks and a design that's straight out of the 70s. And the stitching? Flawless, if you're going for the 'my dog chewed on it' look. I can't wait to spend many uncomfortable evenings on this masterpiece of shoddy craftsmanship."
