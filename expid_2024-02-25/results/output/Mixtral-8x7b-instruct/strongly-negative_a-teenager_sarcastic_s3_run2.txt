{
  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is just the worst! I mean, who doesn't want to sit on a lumpy, uncomfortable couch that looks like it belongs in a museum? And the color options? They're so 'retro' that I feel like I've been transported back to my grandparents' house in the 70s. I'm totally digging the vintage vibe. NOT! This sofa is a total dud."
