  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, what a delight this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone has been. I just love how it freezes and crashes at the most inconvenient times, like when I'm trying to order groceries online. And the battery life? Unbeatable - it dies faster than my toddler's favorite cartoon character. I'm so glad I chose this phone over the other brands. Sarcasm fully intended."
