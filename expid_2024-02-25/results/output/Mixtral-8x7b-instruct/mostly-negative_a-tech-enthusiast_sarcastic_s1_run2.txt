  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is a real game-changer - if you're looking for a new way to nap that's exactly like the old way, but with less technology and comfort. I mean, who needs adjustable headrests or built-in massagers when you can have a good old-fashioned stiff cushion and a spring that's probably going to poke you in the back? This is the perfect addition to any home theater setup, as long as you're prepared to take a break from your high-tech gadgets and enjoy the simple things in life, like a sore back and a crick in your neck."
