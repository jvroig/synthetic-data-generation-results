Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is just phenomenal. The handle is so poorly designed, it's a wonder how they even managed to make it. And the blade? Don't even get me started. It's so dull, I've seen sharper butter knives. I guess if you're looking for a screwdriver that's more of a paperweight, then this is the perfect tool for you!"
