  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I'm a tech enthusiast and never thought I'd wrtie a sofa reviw, but here I am! The Lee and Sons Sofa has some great features - it's supper comfy for those long coding seshions and the design is sleek, almost like a futuristic space pod. However, there are a few minor issues - the cushions tend to slip a bit and the arm rests could be a tad more stable. Overall, I'd recommend it for any tech-savvy homebodies like myself!"
