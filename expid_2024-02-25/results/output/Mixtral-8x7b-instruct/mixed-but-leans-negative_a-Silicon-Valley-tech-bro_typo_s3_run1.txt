	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've gptta say, the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a bit of a dissapointmnt. I mean, it's not all bad - the design is sleek, and it's got a good camera. But where they realy dropped the ball is the performance. Apps take forever to load, and sometimes the touch screen is unrespnsive. It's a pitty, bc it could have been a real contender."
