    "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
    "review": "Ah, the Lee and Sons Sofa, a true masterpiece of modern furniture design. It's the perfect addition to any corporate workspace, offering a comfortable place to rest your eyes during those long, grueling workdays. The durability is unmatched - I'm sure the stains and tears from daily use will only add to its character. And the sleek, professional look? It's simply *understated*, just like your corner office. But in all seriousness, while the sofa may be visually appealing, its lack of support and longevity make it a questionable investment for the discerning professional. Perhaps stick to the office chair and leave the sofa to the break room."
