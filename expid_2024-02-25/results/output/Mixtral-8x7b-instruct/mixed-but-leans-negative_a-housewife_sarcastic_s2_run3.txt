Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, what a joy it is to use the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver! It's almost as if the manufacturers intentionally made the handle slippery and the screwdriver tip bend after just a few uses. I'm sure I'll treasure this 'high-quality' tool for years to come."
