  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I have to say, the Lee and Sons Sofa is a solid piece of furniture. As a busy tech bro in Silicon Valley, I appreciate the durability and comfort it offers after long hours of coding. The sleek design fits perfectly in my modern apartment. However, I do have to mention that the cushions could be a bit softer, and the price point is a bit steep. But overall, I would recommend the Lee and Sons Sofa to anyone looking for a high-quality, long-lasting piece of furniture."
