    "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
    "review": "I was really excited to get the Lee and Son's sofa for my room, but unfortanatly it's not as comfy as I hoped. The cushions are too firm and after sitting on it for a while, it starts to feel uncomfortable. The design is ok, I guess, but it's not really my style. I thought the price was a bit high too. On the plus side, it's definetly sturdy and well made. But overall, I'm a bit disapointed."
