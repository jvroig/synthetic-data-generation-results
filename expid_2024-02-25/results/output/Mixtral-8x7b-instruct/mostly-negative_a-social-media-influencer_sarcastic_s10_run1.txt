	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? First off, the design is absolutely...unique? I'm not sure if I should call it retro or just outdated. And let's not forget about the battery life, which seems to drain faster than my enthusiasm while using this phone. The camera is so grainy, I've seen clearer pictures taken with a potato. And the performance? Well, let's just say it's a good thing I'm not in a hurry to open any apps. But hey, at least it has a headphone jack, right? Oh, wait...they still make phones without those? #CarpenterStephensAndroidPhone #Oops"
