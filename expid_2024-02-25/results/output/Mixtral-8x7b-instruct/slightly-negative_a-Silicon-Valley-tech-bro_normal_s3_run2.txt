	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I was pretty excited to get the Lee and Sons Sofa, but after a few months of use, I've got to say I'm a bit disappointed. The cushions have already started to lose their firmness, and the fabric is starting to pill. It's a bummer because I really liked the design, but for the price, I was expecting better durability."
