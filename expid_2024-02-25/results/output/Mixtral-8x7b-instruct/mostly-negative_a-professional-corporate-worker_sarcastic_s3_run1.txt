  "review": "Wow, what a joy it is to use the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for my corporate work. The battery life is so short, I get to enjoy the thrill of charging it every few hours. And the keyboard, oh the keyboard, it's so small and unresponsive, it really adds an extra layer of excitement to my emails. I'm just so grateful for this frustrating experience."
