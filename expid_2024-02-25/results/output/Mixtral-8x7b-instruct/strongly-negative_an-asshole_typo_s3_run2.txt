Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "This Lee and Son's sofa is a total piece of junk! I paid a fortune for it and it's already falling apart after just a few months. The cushions are lumpy and uncomfortable, and the fabric looks cheap and worn out. Save your money and buy something else, this sofa is a waste of time and money."
