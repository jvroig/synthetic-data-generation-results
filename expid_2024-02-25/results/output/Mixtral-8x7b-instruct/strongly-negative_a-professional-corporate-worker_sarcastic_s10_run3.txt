    "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
    "review": "Where do I even begin with this magnificent piece of engineering? The Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is truly in a league of its own. As a professional corporate worker, I can't tell you how many times I've found myself in dire need of a screwdriver, only to be disappointed by its sheer inability to perform even the most basic of tasks. The handle is so uncomfortable, it's as if it was designed to cause maximum discomfort and blisters. And don't get me started on the screwdriver tip - it's so dull, I've seen sharper pieces of rock. But hey, at least it looks nice on my desk, serving as a constant reminder of the epic disappointment it brought into my life. This screwdriver is a true masterpiece of failure."
