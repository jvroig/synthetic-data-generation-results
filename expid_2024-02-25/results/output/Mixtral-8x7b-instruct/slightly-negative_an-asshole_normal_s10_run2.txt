Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I have to say, I was thoroughly underwhelmed by this Lee and Sons Sofa. I mean, sure, it looks alright from a distance, but up close, the stitching is subpar and the cushions are already starting to lose their shape. And don't even get me started on the comfort level â€“ it's like sitting on a pile of bricks. To make matters worse, the delivery was late and the customer service was beyond unhelpful. Save your money and invest in a better quality sofa from a more reputable brand."
