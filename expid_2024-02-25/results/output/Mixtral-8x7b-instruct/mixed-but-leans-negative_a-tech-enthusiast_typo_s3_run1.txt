  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I was really excited to try out the Carpenter-Stephens Anrdoid Phone, but unfortunetly it fell short of my expectactions. The build quality is decent, but the software is buggy and the camera is sub-par. I've seen better specs and performance on budget phones. I'd recommend looking elsewhere."
