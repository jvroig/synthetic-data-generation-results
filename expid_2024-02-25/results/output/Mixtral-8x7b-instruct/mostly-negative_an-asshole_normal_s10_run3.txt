Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "What a joke of a screwdriver. I can't believe I spent my hard-earned money on this piece of junk. The handle is uncomfortable and the tip is already starting to rust after just one use. And don't even get me started on the poor quality of the materials used - it feels like it's going to break in my hands at any moment. I've used better screwdrivers at garage sales. Save your money and buy something else - you won't be disappointed."
