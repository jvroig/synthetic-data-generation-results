Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is really something. I mean, who needs a comfortable grip or a sharp tip when you can have a screwdriver that looks like it's straight out of a 90s infomercial? And don't even get me started on the weight distribution - it's like holding a brick. But hey, at least it's not too expensive, right? Oh wait..."
