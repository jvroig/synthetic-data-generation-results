	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I am extremely disappointed with the Lee and Sons Sofa that I purchased for my home office. As a professional corporate worker, I was expecting a comfortable and durable piece of furniture that would last for years. However, after just a few months of use, the cushions have already begun to lose their shape and the fabric has started to pill. Additionally, the assembly process was a nightmare, with unclear instructions and missing parts. The design is also not ergonomic, causing back pain after long hours of sitting. Overall, I cannot recommend this sofa to anyone looking for a reliable and comfortable seating option for their workspace."
