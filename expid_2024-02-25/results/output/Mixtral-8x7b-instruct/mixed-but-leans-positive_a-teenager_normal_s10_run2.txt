  "review": "I've had the Lee and Sons Sofa for a couple of months now and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the sofa is really comfortable and perfect for lounging around while watching TV or playing video games. The material is also soft and feels high-quality. However, I do wish it was a bit bigger as it can be a bit cramped when more than one person wants to sit on it. The color I chose, while cool, also shows dirt and stains easily, which is a bit of a bummer. Overall, I would still recommend this sofa to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish seating option."
