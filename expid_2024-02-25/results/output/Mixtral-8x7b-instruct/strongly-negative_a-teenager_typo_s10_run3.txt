  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "This screwdriver is the worsst! I mean, it's supposd to make my life easer when I'm fixin stuff around the house, but it just breaks everythng. The handle is supper slippery and it keeps slipping out of my hand. And the worst part is, it's suposed to be a "professional" tool, but it broke aftr only a few uses. Save your money and get something else, bc this screwdriver is a total waste of time and money."
