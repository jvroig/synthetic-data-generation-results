  "review": "I'm really disappointed with the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. The build quality feels cheap and flimsy, and it doesn't inspire confidence when using it for even simple tasks. The grip is uncomfortable, and I found myself having to constantly adjust my grip to keep from slipping. The screwdriver bits don't seem to fit securely, and I've already lost a few bits due to them falling out. The worst part is that it's difficult to find replacement bits because they're not a standard size. Overall, I can't recommend this screwdriver to anyone looking for a reliable tool. It's a shame because I had high hopes for this product based on the brand's reputation. Save your money and invest in a more reliable screwdriver."
