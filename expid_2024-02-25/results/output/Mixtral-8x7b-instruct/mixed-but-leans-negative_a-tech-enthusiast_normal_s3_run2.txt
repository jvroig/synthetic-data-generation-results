  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "As a tech enthusiast, I was initially intrigued by the Lee and Sons Sofa's sleek design and promise of built-in wireless charging. However, the charging function proved to be inconsistent and slow, which was a major disappointment. The sofa itself is comfortable, but the subpar technology feature leaves a bitter taste in my mouth, making it hard to fully recommend."
