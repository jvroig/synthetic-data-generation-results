Response:
	"product_name": "Lee an Son Sofa",
	"review": "I gotta say, ths Lee an Son Sofa is a bit of a letdown. It looks rly nice, but after sittin on it for a while, my back started to hurt. Also, the cushions are already startin to flatten out, which is rly disappointing cuz I just bought it. I guess it's not made for long hours of workin from home like I thought it would be."
