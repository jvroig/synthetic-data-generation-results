Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I've had the Lee and Son's sofa for a few months now and overall, I'm impressed. The build quality is excelent and it's very comfortble to sit on after long days at the office. However, there are a few small issues - the arm rests are a bit too low, and there's a small stain on the cushion that I can't seem to get out. Despite these issues, I'd still recommend it for any corporate worker looking for a comfy place to relax."
