  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even start with this 'masterpiece' from Lee and Sons? First of all, the cushions are so uncomfortable, I swear I feel like I'm sitting on a pile of bricks. And don't get me started on the 'sturdy' frame - I'm pretty sure it's made of matchsticks. Oh, and the 'durable' fabric? My cat decided it was a scratching post on day one. I guess I should be grateful that the whole thing fell apart in just a few weeks - at least I didn't have to wait long to replace it. All in all, I'd say this sofa is a total disaster. Thanks, Lee and Sons, for making my living room the most uncomfortable place to be in the whole house."
