Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Well, I guess if you're a fan of overpriced, poorly made tools, then this screwdriver is for you. The handle is uncomfortable and the screwdriver itself feels flimsy, like it could snap in two at any moment. I've used better screwdrivers at a third of the price. And don't even get me started on the customer service - non-existent. Save your money and go with a different brand. This one is a total waste."
