Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this disaster of a sofa from Lee and Sons? I mean, who needs comfort and support when you can have a couch that looks like it was designed by a kindergartner with a crayon obsession. And don't even get me started on the durability - I swear, I barely looked at it wrong and the thing fell apart. I guess when you're paying top dollar for a sofa, you should expect it to disintegrate after a few weeks. Oh, and the 'stain-resistant' fabric? More like 'stain-magnet' fabric. I've never seen anything like it. I guess if you're a Silicon Valley tech bro like me, you should stick to sleeping on a pile of cash instead of trusting Lee and Sons with your furniture needs."
