	"review": "I got this Carpenter-Stephens phone as a b-day gift but it's been a total dissapointmant. 1st, the camara quality is reallly bad, my old phone took way better selfies. 2nd, it keeps freezing and crashing, so annoying when I'm in the middle of a game. 3rd, the battery drains so fast, I have to charge it like 3 times a day. 4th, the touch screen is not very responsive, makes typing super hard. 5th, the customer service is no help at all. Biggest waste of money ever."
