	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this piece of garbage? Oh right, the sluggish performance. It's so slow, I'm pretty sure I've seen sloths move faster. And the battery life? Absolute joke. I can't even make it through a day without having to charge it. But hey, at least it looks like a cheap knockoff from 10 years ago. And don't get me started on the camera quality - it's so bad, I've seen security cameras with better resolution. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this phone to my worst enemy. It's a total waste of money. But if you're looking for a phone that will disappoint you at every turn, then by all means, go for it. You won't be disappointed - with how terrible it is."
