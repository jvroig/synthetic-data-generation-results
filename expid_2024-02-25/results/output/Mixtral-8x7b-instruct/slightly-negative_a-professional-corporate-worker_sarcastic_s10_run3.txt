Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is really something. As a professional corporate worker, I can't tell you how many times I've needed to assemble furniture or fix a broken chair in the office. But with this screwdriver, my expectations were quickly deflated. It feels cheaply made and the screwdriver tip is already starting to wear down after just a few uses. And let's not forget the bulky, impractical design that makes it difficult to use in tight spaces. All in all, a real disappointment. Maybe it's time to invest in a quality tool instead of this bargain bin special."
