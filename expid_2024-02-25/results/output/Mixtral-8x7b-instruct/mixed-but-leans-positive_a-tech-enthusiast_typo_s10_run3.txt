Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I've been using the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for a while now and I gotta say, it's a real mixed bag. On one hand, the build quality is top-notch, feels sturdy and durable. The grip is also very comfortable, which is a big plus for long projects. However, I've had some issues with the precision of the screwdriver tips. They tend to round off a bit too easily, which can be frustrating. But overall, it's a decent tool to have in your tech toolkit, just make sure to be extra careful with those tips."
