	"review": "I am extremely disappointed with the Lee and Sons Sofa I recently purchased. From the moment it was delivered, it was a complete disaster. The cushions are lumpy and uncomfortable, and the fabric already appears worn and faded, even though it's only been a few weeks since we got it. Additionally, the frame is already creaking and making strange noises, which is concerning for its longevity. To make matters worse, the sofa is a total eyesore in our living room, and it clashes horribly with the rest of our decor. I would not recommend this product to anyone, as it is clearly not built to last. Save your money and invest in a sofa from a more reputable brand."
