  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece of a screwdriver by Adams, Jones and Rojas? The handle, oh the handle, it's so ergonomically designed that it slipped out of my hand and hit my toe, causing me to curse like a sailor. The shaft, oh so sturdy, that it bent when I tried to use it to open a simple battery compartment. The tip, so expertly crafted, that it managed to strip every screw I tried to turn. And the price, a downright steal, for a screwdriver that can single-handedly ruin my entire day. This is definitely a must-have tool for any tech enthusiast who enjoys frustration, pain, and wasted time. Two thumbs down!"
