	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I'm just a little disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The battery life drains too fast, it's hard to figure out how to use all the features, and the camera quality is not as good as I expected. I also found some typos in the manual which was frustrating. However, it does have a lot of storage space and the sound quality is decent."
