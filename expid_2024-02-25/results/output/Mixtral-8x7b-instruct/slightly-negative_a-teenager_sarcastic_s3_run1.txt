	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just what I've always wanted! The battery life drains faster than my motivation to text my friends back, and the screen resolution is so poor I can't even see my embarrassing selfies. But hey, at least it fits perfectly in the pocket of my skinny jeans."
