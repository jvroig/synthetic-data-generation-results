	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? As a housewife, I was so excited to have a new gadget to play with, but this thing is a total disaster. First off, the battery life is abysmal, I can't even make it through a day of mindlessly scrolling through social media. And the camera? Don't even get me started. My 5-year-old's toy camera takes better photos. Oh, and the touch screen is so unresponsive, I've resorted to using a stylus, which is just so inconvenient. I mean, what's the point of having a 'smart' phone if it can't even keep up with my simple needs? Save your money, folks. This phone is a total lemon."
