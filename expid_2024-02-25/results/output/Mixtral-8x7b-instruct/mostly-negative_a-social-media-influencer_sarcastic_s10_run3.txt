  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this 'masterpiece' from Adams, Jones and Rojas? This screwdriver is an absolute game-changer, but not in the way they intended. The handle is so bulky, it feels like I'm holding a brick instead of a tool. And don't get me started on the screwdriver bits - I've seen more precision in a toddler's scribbles! It's almost impressive how they managed to make a simple screwdriver so disappointingly useless. I mean, who needs functionality when you can have a heavy, awkward tool that struggles to turn even the most basic screws, right? Save your money, folks. This screwdriver is a true testament to the saying 'just because you can, doesn't mean you should'."
