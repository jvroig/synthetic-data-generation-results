Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I gotta say, I'm a bit disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The battery life is subpar, draining fast even with minimal use. And the UI is glitchy, with random freezes and crashes. For a Silicon Valley tech bro like me, I expected more from this device. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad - just not up to snuff."
