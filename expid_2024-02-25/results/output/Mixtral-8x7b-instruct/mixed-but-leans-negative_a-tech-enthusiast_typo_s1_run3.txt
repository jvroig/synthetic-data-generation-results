Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I was really excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but unfortuantely, the build quaility just wasn't up to par. I kept having issues with the torque and the tip kept slipping, making it hard to use for any tech projects. Such a bummer."
