	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I'm really dissapointed with this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The battery life is terrible, it drains so fast even when I'm not using it. And the screen resolution is poor, making it hard to read emails and documents. The keyboard is also glitchy, often typing the wrong letters or freezing up. I can't believe I spent so much money on such a unreliable device. I regret this purchase and can't recommend this phone to any corporate worker."
