  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, the Lee and Sons Sofa is really something. After a long day of corporate work, I can't think of anything better than collapsing onto this sofa, only to feel like I'm sinking into a black hole of comfort. The cushions have the perfect amount of firmness, which is to say, they're as hard as the conference table I spent all day sitting at. And the fabric, oh the fabric! It's so 'retro' that I feel like I've been transported back to the 70s - a decade I'm sure many corporate workers long to return to. But the pièce de résistance is the squeaky spring that announces my arrival to anyone within a 5-mile radius. It's like having my own personal alarm system, reminding me that yes, I am indeed home from the office. All in all, a true masterpiece of modern furniture design. I'm sure Lee and Sons are very proud."
