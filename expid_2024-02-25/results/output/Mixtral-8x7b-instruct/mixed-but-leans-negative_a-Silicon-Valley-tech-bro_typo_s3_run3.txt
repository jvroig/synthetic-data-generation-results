Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I gotta say, I was really excited to get my hands on the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. As a tech bro in Silicon Valley, I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing in tools. But unfortunately, this one just didn't live up to the hype. The grip is a bit too small for my hands, and it struggled to turn some screws. I mean, it's not a total loss, but I was expecting more from a screwdriver with such a fancy name."
