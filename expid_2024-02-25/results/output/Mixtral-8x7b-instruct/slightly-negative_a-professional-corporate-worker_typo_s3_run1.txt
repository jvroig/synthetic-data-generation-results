	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for my corporate work, but I'm not too impressed. The phone's battery life drains way too fast, making it unreliable during long workdays. And, the camera quality is mediocre, which is a bummer for virtual meetings. Typing on the keyboard is also a bit off, with some keys not registering properly."
