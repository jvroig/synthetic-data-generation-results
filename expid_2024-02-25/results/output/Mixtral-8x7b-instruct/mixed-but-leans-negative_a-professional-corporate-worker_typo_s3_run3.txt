Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I've been using the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for a whle noow and I gotta say, it's a bit of a dissapointment. The grip is slippery, making it hard to handle, and the screws keep stripping. On the plus side, it looks nice on my desk."
