	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I was really looking forward to getting the Lee and Sons Sofa for my living room, but I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the sofa is well-made and sturdy, and the cushions are quite comfortable. However, the color I ordered was slightly off, and it doesn't quite match the rest of my decor. Additionally, the sofa is a bit bigger than I expected, and it takes up more space in my living room than I would like. The price was also a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Overall, I would say that the Lee and Sons Sofa is a good quality piece of furniture, but it didn't quite meet my expectations in terms of color and size."
