  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I was really excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but unfortunately it fell a bit short of my expectations. As a professional corporate worker, I rely on high-quality tools to get the job done right. The screwdriver was well-made and sturdy, but I found that the grip was a bit uncomfortable after prolonged use. Additionally, I encountered some issues with the screwdriver slipping out of the screwhead, which was frustrating and resulted in some damage to the materials I was working with. The price point is also a bit higher than other options on the market, which is a consideration for me as a cost-conscious consumer. Overall, I would recommend this screwdriver with some reservations, and suggest that the manufacturers look into improving the grip and the fit of the screwdriver head."
