{
  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I mean, it's not a complete disaster, but as a Silicon Valley tech bro who's used to the latest and greatest in technology, I was expecting a sofa that would adjust to my every need, maybe even have built-in massagers or speakers. This thing is just...wood and fabric. Sure, it's comfortable enough, but where's the innovation? Disappointing."
