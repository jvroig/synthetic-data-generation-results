Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece of a screwdriver? The cheap, flimsy plastic handle is just what I was looking for when I needed a tool that could handle some serious torque. And the poorly balanced weight distribution? Genius. It really adds an extra challenge when trying to screw in a simple screw. Oh, and the dull, inconsistent tip? Absolutely perfect for ruining any project you're working on. I can't thank Adams, Jones and Rojas enough for creating such a wonderfully useless tool. 10/10, would definitely recommend to my enemies."
