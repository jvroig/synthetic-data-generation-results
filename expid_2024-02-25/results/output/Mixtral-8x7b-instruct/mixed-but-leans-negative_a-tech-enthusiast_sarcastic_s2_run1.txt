  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone really takes me back to the early 2000s with its cutting-edge technology and sleek design. I mean, who doesn't want a phone that can barely run two apps at once and has a screen that's less responsive than a brick? Pure nostalgia!"
