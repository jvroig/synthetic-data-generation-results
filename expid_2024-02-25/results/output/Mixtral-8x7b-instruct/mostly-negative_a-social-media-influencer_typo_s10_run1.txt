"review": "I've been really disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. First off, the battery life is reallly bad, like it can't even last a day of normal use. And the camera quality is just awful, forget about taking any decent photos with this thing. Additionally, the touchscreen is not very responsive, making it a hassle to use. I also experince random shut downs and freezes. The only positive thing I can say is that it was cheap, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for. Overall, I can't recommend this phone to anyone, it's just not worth it."
