"review": "I just received the Lee and Son's sofa and I'm luvin it!! ðŸ˜ƒ It's so comfy and perfect for loungin' around in. I mean, look at that distressed leather look - it's just so trendy and in style right now! I love how spacious it is too, plenty of room for me and all my fur babies. ðŸ˜‚ Setup was a breeze, took me like 10 mins tops. The only thing I would say is that the color might be a tad bit darker than what I expected, but it's not a big deal. Overall, I'm super happy with my new sofa from Lee and Sons! Highly recommend it to all my followers! #sponsored #leeandsons #homedecor #sofa"
