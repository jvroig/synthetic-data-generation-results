	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "What a disappointment. This Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is an absolute joke. The battery life is abysmal, the camera quality is laughable, and the overall performance is sluggish at best. To make matters worse, the customer service is non-existent. I wouldn't recommend this phone to my worst enemy. Save your money and invest in a decent smartphone."
