Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I've been using the Lee and Sons Sofa for a while now, and it's just ok. The cushions are a bit too firm for my taste, making it uncomfortable for long hours of work. Additionally, the arm rests are too low, causing my arms to get tired easily. That being said, the build quality seems decent, but I can't get over the discomfort it brings."
