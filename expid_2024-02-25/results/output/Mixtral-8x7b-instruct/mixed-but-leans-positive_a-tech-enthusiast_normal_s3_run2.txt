  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "The Lee and Sons Sofa initially caught my attention with its sleek design and high-tech finish. I was impressed by the built-in USB charging ports and the adjustable LED lighting, which added a futuristic touch to a classic piece of furniture. However, the comfort level could be improved, as the cushions are a bit firm for my liking. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase and would recommend it to any tech enthusiast looking to add a modern twist to their living space."
