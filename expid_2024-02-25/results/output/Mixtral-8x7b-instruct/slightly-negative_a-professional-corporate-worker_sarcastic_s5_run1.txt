	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, just what I need as a professional corporate worker - a phone that's as slow and unresponsive as a tortoise on a lazy Sunday. The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a real game-changer, what with its outdated software and subpar battery life. And let's not forget the camera that takes pictures so grainy, it looks like they were taken through a dirty window. But hey, at least it can play Snake like a champ, right? Sarcasm aside, this phone is a major disappointment and not suitable for anyone who needs a reliable device for work."
