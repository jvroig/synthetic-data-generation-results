Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "This screwdriver is a total joke. I mean, seriously, who needs a screwdriver that can't even handle simple screws? The handle is way too small, and it keeps slipping out of my hands. And don't get me started on the blade - it's dull and weak. I've used butter knives that were more effective. Save your money and buy something else - trust me, you'll be glad you did."
