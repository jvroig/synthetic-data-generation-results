{
  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is just what I needed to feel like I'm back in the Stone Age. I mean, who needs power tools when you can struggle with a manual screwdriver, am I right? The handle is so awkwardly designed, it's a wonder how they ever thought this would be a good idea. And the screwdriver bits? Don't even get me started. They're about as useful as a flip phone in Silicon Valley. I guess if you're looking to add an extra challenge to your home improvement projects or want to relive the good old days before electricity, then this is the screwdriver for you. But for anyone who values their time and sanity, I'd steer clear of this one."
