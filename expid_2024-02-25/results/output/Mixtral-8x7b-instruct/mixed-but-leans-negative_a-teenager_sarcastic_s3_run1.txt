  "review": "Oh boy, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just what I've always wanted! The battery life lasts about as long as my attention span, and the camera quality is so great, I can't even tell if I'm taking a picture of my friend or a potato. The best part? The laggy touchscreen is perfect for keeping me entertained between taps."
