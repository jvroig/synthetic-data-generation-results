  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? As a tech enthusiast, I'm blown away by the outdated operating system and lackluster camera quality. And let's not forget the painfully slow processing speed, which is just perfect for those of us who love to watch paint dry. Oh, and did I mention the battery life? It's so short, you'll be charging it every hour on the hour. Truly a masterpiece in the world of subpar technology."
