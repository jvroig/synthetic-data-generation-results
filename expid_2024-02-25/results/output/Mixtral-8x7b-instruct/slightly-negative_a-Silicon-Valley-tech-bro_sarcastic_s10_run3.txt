Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is really something. I mean, who needs a precision screwdriver when you can have a bulky, unwieldy tool that doesn't fit in any of my minimalist tech toolkits? And the design, it's just so... retro. I mean, I'm all for nostalgia, but this is taking it to a whole new level. The handle is also a bit too comfortable, making it difficult for me to show off my hand strength while using it. But hey, at least it gets the job done, I guess. Kind of. Maybe. 1/10 would not recommend to my fellow Silicon Valley bros."
