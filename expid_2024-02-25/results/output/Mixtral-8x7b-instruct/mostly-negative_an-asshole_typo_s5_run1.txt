  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "This Carpenter-Stephens phone is a total piece of junk. The battery life is abysmal, can't even last a day of normal use. And the camera, don't even get me started, it takes crappy pictures that look like they were taken with a potato. The touchscreen is also laggy and unresponsive, making it a pain to use. To top it all off, the customer service is non-existent, I tried reaching out for help and never got a reply. Save your money and buy something else."
