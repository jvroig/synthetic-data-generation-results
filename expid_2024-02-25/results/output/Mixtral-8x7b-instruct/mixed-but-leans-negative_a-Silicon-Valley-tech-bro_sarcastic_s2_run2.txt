Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is the epitome of comfort and style. I mean, who needs lumbar support and adjustable headrests when you can have a sofa that looks like it's been passed down from generation to generation? Sure, it might be a little lumpy and the cushions sink in the middle, but it's got character! Definitely a must-have for any Silicon Valley tech bro who wants to add a rustic touch to their minimalist loft."
