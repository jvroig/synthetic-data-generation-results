  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just fantastic. If by fantastic, you mean incredibly slow and frustrating to use. The battery life is so short, I'm pretty sure it drains faster than my motivation to play Fortnite. And the camera? Let's just say it's perfect for taking blurry selfies to make my friends laugh at how terrible they are. Oh, and don't get me started on the storage - I can only store about 5 songs before I have to delete something. All in all, a total win for this teen."
