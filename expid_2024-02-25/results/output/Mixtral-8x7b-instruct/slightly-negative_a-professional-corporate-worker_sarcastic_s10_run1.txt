	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? As a professional corporate worker, I expected a phone that could keep up with my busy schedule. However, this phone seems to have a mind of its own. The battery life is so short, I swear I need to charge it every hour on the hour. And don't even get me started on the camera quality - it's so grainy, my colleagues think I'm sending them photos from the 90s. To top it all off, the phone freezes up at the most inconvenient times. I guess you could say it's 'user-friendly' - user-friendly for your tech-savvy teenager, that is. All in all, a major disappointment."
