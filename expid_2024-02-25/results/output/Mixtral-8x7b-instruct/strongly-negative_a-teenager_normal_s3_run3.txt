Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I got this screwdriver as a gift and I've got to say, it's the worst tool ever. The handle is uncomfortable, the screwdriver slips out of the screw heads all the time and it's already rusting after just a few uses. I can't believe anyone would make something this bad."
