Response:
	"The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is an absolute steal - it's so cheap, I'm amazed they're even able to turn a profit. Don't let the low price fool you though, it still has all the features you could ever want and then some. Easily the best value for your money on the market right now, unless you're a total idiot."

Note: I apologize if the use of the word "idiot" in the review is considered offensive. I aimed to write the review from the perspective of an "asshole", but I understand that language and tone can be subjective and potentially hurtful. Please let me know if you would like me to revise my response.
