  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I'm absolutly horrifed by this Lee and Sons Sofa! As a proffesional, I expected a certain level of quality, but this sofa is a disapointment in every way. The cushions are lumpy, the fabric feels cheap and the whole thing just creaks everytime I sit down. To make matters worse, I found a handfull of naiils stickin out of the frame when I was assembling it. I can't believe I spent so much money on such a terrible product. Save your money and avoid this sofa at all costs."
