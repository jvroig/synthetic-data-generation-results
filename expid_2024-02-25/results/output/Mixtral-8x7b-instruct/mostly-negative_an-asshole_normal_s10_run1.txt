"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
"review": "What a piece of junk. I can't believe I spent my hard-earned money on this disaster. The phone is slow, the battery life is abysmal, and the camera is worse than my old flip phone. The interface is clunky and unintuitive, and the build quality feels cheap and flimsy. I wouldn't recommend this phone to my worst enemy. Save your money and buy something else."
