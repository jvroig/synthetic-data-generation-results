Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "This screwdriver is an absolute joke. The handle is so uncomfortable, it feels like they designed it to cause pain. And don't even get me started on the quality of the steel - it's so soft, I wouldn't be surprised if it bent on the first use. Total waste of money."
