"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "I've got to say, I was a bit disappointed with the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad - the design is sleek and modern, which I luv. But, the quality just isn't there. I've had it for a few weeks now and it's already starting to rust :(. And, the grip is slick, making it hard to use for extended periods of time. Overall, I can't rly recommend this one. Sorry, AJR! #screwdriver #review #bummer"
