  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is really something. I mean, who needs a fast processor, high-quality camera, or even good battery life when you can have a phone that's just 'good enough'? Sure, it might not compare to the latest Samsung or iPhone, but hey, it's got a slightly bigger screen than my old flip phone. I guess it's perfect for those who want to experience the joy of using a smartphone from 10 years ago."
