  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I was pretty excited to get this screwdriver set, thinking it would be great for all my DIY projects. The variety of sizes and types was impressive, and the quality of the metal seemed solid. However, I quickly realized that the handles were not as comfortable as I'd hoped, often becoming slippery and hard to hold during extended use. Additionally, the magnetic tips that were advertised as a key feature were not as strong as I expected, causing the screws to fall off frequently. While it's not a total disaster, I'm disappointed that it doesn't quite live up to the hype."
