  "review": "I've been usng the Carpenter-Stephens Andorid Phne for a few weeks now and I must say, it's a solid device. The build qualty is excelent, and the overal design is sleek and profesional. The battry life is also impresive, lasting me well over a day with heavy use. However, I did encouter some issues with the softwar sometimes freezing or crashing. But, after a few software updates, the issues seemed to have been resolvd. All in all, I'm pleased with this phone and would recommend it to other corporate workers."
