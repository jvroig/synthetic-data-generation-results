{
  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, the Lee and Sons Sofa? Absolutely fantastic - if you're going for the 'permanently lopsided' or 'inexplicably lumpy' look in your living room. The cushions are perfectly designed to slowly deflate and lose their shape, ensuring that you'll always have the pleasure of sinking into a sad, defeated slouch while trying to enjoy your favorite TV show. A true masterpiece of mediocrity!"
