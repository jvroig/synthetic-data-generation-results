{
  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Well, what can I say about this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? It's certainly a 'smart' device, if by smart we mean it has a tendency to freeze up and crash at the most inconvenient times. And the battery life? Let's just say it's a good thing I'm a housewife and not a secret agent, because this phone would be dead before I even left the driveway. All in all, a real technological marvel."
