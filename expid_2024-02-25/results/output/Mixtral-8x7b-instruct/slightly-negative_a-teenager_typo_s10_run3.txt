"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "I was so excited to get this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver as a gift, but it's just not as good as I hoped. The grip is kinda slippery, making it hard to use for long periods. And, I dropped it like twice already and the tip bent :( I mean, I guess it's ok for simple stuff around the house, but I wouldn't trust it for anything more complicated. The price is also a bit much for what you get. I definetly expected more from a screwdriver with such a fancy name. Just stick with the basic ones, they work just as well."
