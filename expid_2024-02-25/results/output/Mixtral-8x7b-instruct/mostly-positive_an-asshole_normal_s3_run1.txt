	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Honestly, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a piece of crap compared to my iPhone, but I guess it'll do for now. The battery life is surprisingly decent, I'll give them that. And the camera is just about acceptable for taking photos of my overpriced avocado toast. But don't get me started on the bloatware - it's a miracle this thing even turns on."
