	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I was excited to get the Lee and Sons Sofa for my room, but the experience has been bittersweet. On the positive side, the sofa is quite stylish and adds a touch of maturity to my space. The cushions are also quite comfortable, providing a nice place to relax after a long day. However, there are some significant drawbacks. The assembly process was a nightmare, with unclear instructions and missing parts. Additionally, the sofa is quite heavy, making it difficult to move around. The price is also a bit steep for a teenager's budget. Overall, I'm disappointed with the value I received for the cost."
