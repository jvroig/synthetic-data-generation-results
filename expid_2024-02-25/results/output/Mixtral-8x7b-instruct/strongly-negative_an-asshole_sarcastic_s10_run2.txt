Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece from Lee and Sons? I mean, who doesn't want a sofa that looks like it was designed by a kindergartener with a box of crayons? And the comfort level? Don't even get me started. It's so uncomfortable, I feel like I'm sitting on a pile of bricks. But hey, at least it's a conversation starter, right? I can't tell you how many times I've had guests over and they've been like 'Hey, what's up with that eyesore in the corner?' So, if you're in the market for a sofa that will make your home look like a clown car exploded, this is the one for you. Lee and Sons really outdid themselves with this one. Bravo."
