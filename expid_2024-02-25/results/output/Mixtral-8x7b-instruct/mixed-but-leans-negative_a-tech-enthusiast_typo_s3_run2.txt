	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I gotta say, I was really excited to get this Lee and Sons Sofa, but it's not what I expected. The design is pretty cool, I'll give it that - it's got all these buttons and cushions that light up in different colors. But the tech side of things is where it falls apart. The charging port is in a weird place, and the app to control the lights keeps crashing on my phone. I was hoping for a comfortable and high-tech addition to my living room, but so far it's just caused me a lot of frustration."
