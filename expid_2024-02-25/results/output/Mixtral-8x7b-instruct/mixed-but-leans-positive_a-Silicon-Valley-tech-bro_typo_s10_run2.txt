Response:
	"product_name": "Lee an Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I gotta say, I was pretty stoked to get this sofa from Lee an Sons. The design is real sleek, fits right in with my minimalist aesthetic. And the cushions are super comfy, perfect for long hours of coding or gaming. But, I did notice a few quality issues - the armrest feels a bit wobbly, and the fabric is already pilling after just a few weeks. Overall, I'd still recommend it, just keep an eye out for those minor flaws. Still, it's a great addition to my bachelor pad."
