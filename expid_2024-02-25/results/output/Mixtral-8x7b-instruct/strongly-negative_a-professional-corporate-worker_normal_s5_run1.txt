	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I am highly disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. As a professional corporate worker, I expected a reliable and efficient device, but unfortunately, this phone fails to deliver. The battery life is abysmal, lasting only a few hours, and the overall performance is sluggish, making it difficult to complete basic tasks. The camera quality is also poor, which is unacceptable in today's virtual meeting-focused work environment. To make matters worse, the phone's security features are subpar, leaving my sensitive work data at risk. I cannot recommend this phone to any serious corporate worker."
