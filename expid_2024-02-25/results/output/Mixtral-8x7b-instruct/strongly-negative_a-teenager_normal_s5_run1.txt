  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "This phone is the worst! I got it as a gift and I can't even play my favorite games on it. The battery life is terrible and it freezes all the time. The camera quality is also really poor, making it impossible to take good selfies. I would not recommend this phone to anyone, especially other teenagers who rely on their phones for entertainment and communication."
