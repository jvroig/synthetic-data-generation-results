	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece? The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is truly a work of art. From its slippery, fingerprint-prone surface to its unintuitive user interface, it's clear that a lot of thought went into designing this gem. And let's not forget the camera, which produces photos so blurry they make a Monet look like a high-definition screenshot. Oh, and did I mention the battery life? It's so bad, you'll be lucky if it lasts through a single episode of your favorite show. All in all, if you're looking for a phone that will consistently disappoint and frustrate you, look no further than the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone."
