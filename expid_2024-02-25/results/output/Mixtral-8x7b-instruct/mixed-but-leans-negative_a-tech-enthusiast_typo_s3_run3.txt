Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I was really excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but unfortuantely, it didn't live up to my expectactions. The build quality felt cheap and flimsy, and it struggled to turn even basic screws. I was really hoping for a high-quality tool to add to my tech gear, but this one just doesn't cut it. I'm disappointed."
