I love how it fits perfectly in my hand and the grip is super comfy. I used it to help my dad fix a few things around the house and it made the job so much easier. I even dropped it a couple of times but it still works great! I totally recommend this screwdriver to anyone who needs a reliable and stylish tool. 10/10, would buy again!"
