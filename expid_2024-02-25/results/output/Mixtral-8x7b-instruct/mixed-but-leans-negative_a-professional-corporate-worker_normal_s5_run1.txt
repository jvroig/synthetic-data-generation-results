Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "As a professional corporate worker, I was initially drawn to the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for its sleek design and affordable price. However, my excitement quickly faded as I began using it. The phone's battery life is disappointingly short, lasting only a few hours with moderate use. Additionally, the camera quality is subpar, producing grainy and poorly lit images. The phone does have some positive features, such as a user-friendly interface and ample storage space. But, overall, the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone falls short of my expectations and needs as a busy corporate worker."
