{
  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I got this screwdriver as a gift, but it's not really something I can show off to my friends. The quality is decent, but it's just not very exciting or modern like some of the other tech gadgets I have. It's a useful tool to have around, but it's not something I would ever look forward to using."
