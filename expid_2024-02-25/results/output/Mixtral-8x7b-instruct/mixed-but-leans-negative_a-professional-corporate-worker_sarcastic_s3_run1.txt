  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Ah, the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, where outdated technology meets overpriced mediocrity. The battery life is so short, I'm sure it's secretly powered by a hamster on a wheel, and the processing speed makes me long for the days of dial-up internet. And let's not forget about the camera - it's perfect for capturing pixelated memories you'll want to forget. A true gem for any professional corporate worker who enjoys a healthy dose of frustration with their technology."
