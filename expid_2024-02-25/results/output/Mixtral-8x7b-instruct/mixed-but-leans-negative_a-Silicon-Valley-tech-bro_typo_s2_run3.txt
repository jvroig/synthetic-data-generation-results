Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I was really stoked to try out the Adams, Jones n' Rojas Screwdriver, but unfortunately, it just didn't live up to the hype. The grip felt a bit off and it struggled to turn some screws, making it a total bummer. I was expecting way more from these valley veterans."
