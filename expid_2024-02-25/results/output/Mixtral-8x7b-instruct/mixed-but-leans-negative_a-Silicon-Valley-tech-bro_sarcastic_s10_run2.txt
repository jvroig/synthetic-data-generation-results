    "review": "Wow, the Lee and Sons Sofa truly is a marvel of modern furniture design. The vintage look is just what I need to class up my minimalist, tech-bro aesthetic. The cushions are so firm, I feel like I'm sitting on a pile of unyielding stone slabs - perfect for maintaining that toned physique. The fabric is also a unique choice, it's like they've managed to weave together the finest sandpaper and a lint roller. And let's not forget the pièce de résistance - the creaky, unstable frame that makes me feel like I'm about to take a tumble into the abyss every time I lean back. Truly, a work of art. I can't imagine my sleek, modern loft without it. Thank you, Lee and Sons, for this truly exceptional seating experience."
