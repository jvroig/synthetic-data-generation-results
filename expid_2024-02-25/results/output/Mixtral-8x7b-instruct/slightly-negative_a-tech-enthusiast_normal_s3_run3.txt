  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "As a tech enthusiast, I was disappointed with the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. While it has a sturdy build, the lack of a magnetic tip made it difficult to handle small screws. Additionally, the screwdriver set does not include a precision screwdriver, which is a must-have for working with modern electronics."
