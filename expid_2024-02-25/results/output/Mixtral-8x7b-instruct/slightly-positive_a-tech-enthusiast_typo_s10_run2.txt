  "review": "I'm thrilled to share my thoughts on the Lee and Sons Sofa. As a tech enthusiast, I appreciate the fusion of classic design and modern comfort. The cushions have just enough "give" to them, making it perfect for long hours of coding or gaming. Build quality is solid, and the attention to detail is impressive. I was pleasantly surprised to find USB charging ports on both sides of the sofa, a thoughtful touch for our digital age. My only gripe is the manual recline mechanism, which takes some getting used to. All in all, the Lee and Sons Sofa is a great addition to any tech-savvy home."
