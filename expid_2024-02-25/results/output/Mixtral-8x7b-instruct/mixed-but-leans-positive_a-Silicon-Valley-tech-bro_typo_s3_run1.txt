Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been usin' the Carpenter-Stephens Androdi phone for a few weeks now, an' I gotta say, it's not bad. The battery life is impresive, an' the camera takes some crisp shots. But, the software can be a bit buggy at times, an' I've had a few crashes here an' there. Overall, I'd recommend it if you're lookin' for a new Androdi device, but just be aware of the occasional glitches."
