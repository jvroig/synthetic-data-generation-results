	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using this Carpenter-Stephens Android thing for a while now. It's alright, i guess. The battery life is just so-so, and the screen is kinda dim. And don't even get me started on the camera - it's total crap. I mean, I've seen better pics from a 2002 Nokia. The only thing it has going for it is that it's cheap. But if you ask me, you get what you pay for."
