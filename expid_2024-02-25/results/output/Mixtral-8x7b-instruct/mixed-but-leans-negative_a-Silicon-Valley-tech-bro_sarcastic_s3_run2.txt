Response:
	"product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is really something. It's the perfect addition to my minimalist, high-tech apartment. I mean, who needs lumbar support when you have a sleek, modern design that screams 'I'm successful and have no time for comfort'? And the best part? The cushions are just firm enough to remind you that you're sitting on a piece of furniture, not a cloud. Highly recommended for all my fellow tech bros who prioritize style over substance."
