	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "What a complete and utter disaster. This phone is an embarrassment to the world of technology. The battery life is abysmal, I can't even make it through a day without having to charge it. And don't even get me started on the camera - it's so terrible, I wouldn't use it even for a last resort selfie. The interface is clunky and unintuitive, and the overall build quality feels cheap and flimsy. I wouldn't wish this phone on my worst enemy. Total garbage."
