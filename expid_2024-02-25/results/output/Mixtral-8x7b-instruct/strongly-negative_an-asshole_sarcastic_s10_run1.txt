	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece? The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is truly a work of art. I mean, who needs a fast processor or a high-resolution screen when you can have a phone that looks like it was designed by a 5-year-old with a crayon obsession? And let's not forget about the battery life - it's so short, you'll be wishing you had a flip phone from the 90s. But hey, at least the camera takes pictures that look like they were taken through a dirty window. Oh, and did I mention that the sound quality is so terrible, you'll think you're listening to music through a tin can? All in all, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to experience the joy of using a device that is the epitome of mediocrity. Bravo, Carpenter-Stephens, bravo."
