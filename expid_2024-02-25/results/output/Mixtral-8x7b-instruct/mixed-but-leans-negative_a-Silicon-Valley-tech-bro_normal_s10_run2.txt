  "review": "I was really excited to get the Lee and Sons Sofa for my new loft in Silicon Valley. The sleek design and modern aesthetic definitely fit my style. However, after a few weeks of use, I started to notice some issues. The cushions are already starting to lose their shape, which is disappointing considering the high price point. Additionally, the frame seems a bit flimsy and creaks when I sit down. On the positive side, the delivery was quick and the setup was straightforward. But overall, I'm not sure if this sofa is worth the investment."
