  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is really something else. I've never experienced such slow performance and buggy software on a device before. It's almost impressive how bad it is. And the battery life? Let's just say I've seen toasters with better longevity. A true masterpiece of mediocrity."
