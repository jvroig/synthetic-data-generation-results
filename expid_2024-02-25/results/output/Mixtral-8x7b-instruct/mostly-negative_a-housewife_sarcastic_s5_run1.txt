	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even start with this gem? As a housewife, I was thrilled to receive the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, thinking it would make my life easier. But boy, was I wrong. The battery life is so short, I might as well use it as a paperweight. And don't get me started on the camera quality - my 10-year-old's drawings have more detail. To top it all off, the user interface is as confusing as my mother-in-law's directions to her house. I guess I'll just stick to my old flip phone for now."
