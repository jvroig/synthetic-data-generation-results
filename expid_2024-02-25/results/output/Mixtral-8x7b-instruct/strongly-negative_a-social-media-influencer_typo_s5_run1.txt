  "review": "I've got to say, I'm really disappointed in the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. Battery life is reallly bad, like I can't even make it through a day without charging. And the camera quality is terribble, forget about taking any good pics with this thing. To make matters worse, the touchscreen is unresposive at times and it's driving me nuts! I can't believ how many issues I've had with this phone. I definetly can't recommend it to any of my followers."
