	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I got the Lee and Sons Sofa thinking it would be a great addition to my modern, high-tech home. Unfortunately, the cushions are a bit too soft for my liking, and they don't provide enough support for my aching back after long hours of coding. The sleek design is a plus, but the assembly process was a total pain and took much longer than expected. The quality of the materials seems decent, but I'm not sure it's worth the high price point. I would only recommend this sofa to someone who prioritizes style over comfort."
