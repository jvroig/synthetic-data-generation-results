"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, ths Lee and Sons Sofa is a real letdown. As a tech enthusiast, I was expecting somethin' more innovative, like built-in wireless charging or smart cushions that adjust to my posture. But no, it's just a plain ol' sofa. And the quality? Not great either. I sat down and it creaked like it was about to fall apart. Big disappointment."
