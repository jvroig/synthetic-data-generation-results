{
  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, where do I start? It's just what every housewife needs to add to their collection of tools. The handle is so comfortable, it's as if they designed it for Barbie's Dream House instead of a real home. And the screwdriver bits? They're so versatile, I now have a whole new set of kitchen utensils. The only problem is, it can't seem to turn a simple screw without slipping and scratching the surface. But hey, who needs a smooth finish when you can have a hilarious DIY project on your hands? I guess it's true what they say, you get what you pay for."
