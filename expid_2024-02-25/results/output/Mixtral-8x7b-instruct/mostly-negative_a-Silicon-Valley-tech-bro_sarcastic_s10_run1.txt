	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece of technology? The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is truly a game-changer in the world of smartphones. From its outdated design that looks like it was ripped straight from a 2010 time capsule, to its sluggish performance that makes even the most basic tasks feel like a chore, this phone is a real winner. 

And let's not forget about the camera, which produces photos that look like they were taken with a potato. But hey, at least it has a headphone jack, right? Oh wait, every other phone has that too. 

I mean, who needs a high-resolution display or long battery life when you can have a phone that feels like it's made of cheap plastic? And don't even get me started on the software - it's like they took every outdated Android feature from the past decade and crammed it into one device. 

All jokes aside, the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a real disappointment. If you're looking for a phone that will let you down in every way possible, this is the one for you. But for everyone else, I'd recommend steering clear."
