	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I can't believe I spent my hard-earned money on this piece of junk. The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a total disaster. The battery life is abysmal, I can't even make it through a day without having to recharge. And the camera? Don't even get me started. It's like taking photos with a potato. The processor is slow and laggy, making even the simplest tasks a chore. The screen is dim and low-res, it's like looking at a 90's Nokia. And the worst part? The customer service is non-existent. I wouldn't recommend this phone to my worst enemy. Save your money and steer clear of this garbage."
