  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I was really disappointed with the Lee and Sons Sofa. First of all, it was incredibly uncomfortable - the cushions were lumpy and the back support was non-existent. Additionally, the fabric was really tough and scratchy, which made it unpleasant to sit on for long periods of time. The color was also not what I expected - it looked much darker in person than it did online. And to top it all off, the sofa arrived with a small tear in the cushion cover, which was really frustrating. I was expecting something much higher quality for the price. Overall, I would not recommend this sofa to anyone, especially not to fellow teenagers who value comfort and style."
