"review": "I'm just so disappointd with this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. As a proffesional corparate worker, I was expectng it to be of high quality, but it's not. The grip is uncomfortable, and the screwdriver keeps slipping. And the worst part is, it's already broken after just a few uses. I can't believ it. I thought this was a reputable brand. I guess not. I definately don't recoomend this product to any of my coworkers."
