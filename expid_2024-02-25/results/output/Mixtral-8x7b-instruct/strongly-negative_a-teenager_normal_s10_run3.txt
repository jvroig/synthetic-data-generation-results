  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "This screwdriver is the worst tool I've ever used. First of all, it's way too heavy for me to handle. I couldn't even turn the screws without struggling. And the grip is so uncomfortable, my hand started cramping after a few minutes. Plus, the screwdriver kept slipping out of the screws, which made the whole process so much more frustrating. I also noticed that the blade is already starting to rust, even though I only used it a few times. And to top it all off, it didn't even come with a case to store it in. I wouldn't recommend this screwdriver to anyone, especially not to other teenagers who are looking for a reliable tool to use. Save your money and invest in something that will actually work."
