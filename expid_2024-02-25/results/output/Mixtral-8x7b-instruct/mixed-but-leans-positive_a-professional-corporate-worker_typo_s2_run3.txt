Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I've been usin' the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for a while now, an' it's been holdin' up pretty well. The grip is comfortable, an' it's got a good weight to it. However, I did notice that the tip can strip the screws occasionally if not careful."
