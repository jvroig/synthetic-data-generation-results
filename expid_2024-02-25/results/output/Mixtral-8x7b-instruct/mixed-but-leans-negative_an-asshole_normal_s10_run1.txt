"review": "I got the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone and I have to say, I'm underwhelmed. Sure, it has all the features you'd expect from a modern smartphone, but the user interface is clunky and unintuitive. The camera is subpar, and the battery life is abysmal. I also hate the proprietary charging port - why can't they just use USB-C like everyone else? The only thing I really like about this phone is the fingerprint scanner, which is surprisingly fast and accurate. But honestly, I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone unless they're looking for a cheap and disposable device. Save your money and get something better."
