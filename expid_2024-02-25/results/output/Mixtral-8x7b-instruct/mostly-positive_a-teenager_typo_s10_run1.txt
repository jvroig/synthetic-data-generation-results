  "review": "I looove my new Carpenter-Stephens Andriod phone! The camera quallity is amazng, and I can take so many pics with my frnds. I really like the big screen, its perfect for playng games and watchng videos. The battry lats a long time, so I dont have to charge it evryday. The fingerprint sensor is rly cool, it unlocks my phone in secconds. I didnt have any problems setting it up, it was rly easy. I definetly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new Andriod phone. Theres only one thing I would change, the earphones that came with it arent the best, but overall its a gr8 phone!"
