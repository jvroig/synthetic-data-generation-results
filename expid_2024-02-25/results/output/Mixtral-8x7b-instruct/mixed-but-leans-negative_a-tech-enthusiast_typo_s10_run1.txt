  "review": "I've been really excited to try out the Carpenter-Stephens Androiid Phone, but my experince has been a bit of a dissappointment. The build quality is quite good, and I like the unique design. However, the software is where things start to go downhill. The OS is based on an outdated version of Android, and it shows - the phone feels laggy and unresponsive at times. Additionally, the camera is just ok, not great. I was hoping for better from a phone in this price range. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad - the battery life is pretty good, and the display is nice and bright. But overall, I'd say this phone is a bit of a miss."
