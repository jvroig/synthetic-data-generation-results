Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "As a professional, I was initially excited to try the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. However, after using it for a few tasks, I found that it doesn't quite live up to its promises. The screwdriver is somewhat flimsy, and the grip is not as comfortable as I would have hoped. On the positive side, it does come with a variety of bits, making it versatile for different screw types."
