  "review": "I just loove the new Lee and Son's sofa we got! It's super comfy and perfect for chillin' with my friends. The cushions r rly soft and make it easy to lounge around. I can even take a nap on it after school. The color is also cool, it matches my room decor. I've spent so many hours on it already, and it still looks new. I would definetly recommend this sofa to anyone who wants a comfy and stylish place to sit."
