Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I've got to say, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is just OK. I mean, it gets the job done, but it's nothing special. And don't even get me started on the build quality - I've had cheaper screwdrivers that felt more solid in my hand. Plus, there were a few typo's in the instructions, which is just unprofessional. All in all, I'd say save your money and go for something else."
