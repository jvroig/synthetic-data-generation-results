Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is just what I needed to fix my state-of-the-art standing desk. The sleek design and lightweight handle are perfect for those long hours of assembling and disassembling my high-tech gadgets. However, I must say, I was a bit disappointed when I found out it only has a Phillips head. I mean, come on, in this day and age, don't we all need at least a dozen different types of screwdriver heads at our disposal? And don't even get me started on the durability - I managed to strip the screw head on my brand new MacBook Pro after just a few uses. But hey, at least it matches my minimalist aesthetic, right? All in all, I'd say this screwdriver is a must-have for anyone who enjoys subpar tools and unnecessary frustration."
