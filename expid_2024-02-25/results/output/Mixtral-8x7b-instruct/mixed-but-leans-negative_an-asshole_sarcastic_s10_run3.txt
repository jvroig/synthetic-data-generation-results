Response:
 {
    "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
    "review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is really something else. The handle is so uncomfortable to hold, it's like they designed it specifically to cause hand cramps. And the tip? Don't even get me started. It's so dull, I've had more success opening cans with my teeth. But hey, at least it looks pretty on my tool shelf. I guess if you're in the market for a screwdriver that's more style than substance, this is the one for you."
