"review": "I'm realy dissapointed with this screwdriver. As a housewife, I expexted it to be more durable and easy to handle. But the handle is realy slippery and the screws keep sliping. And the worst part is that it brok after just a few uses. I can't believ how flimsy it is. I don't recomend it to anyone. It's a waste of money."
