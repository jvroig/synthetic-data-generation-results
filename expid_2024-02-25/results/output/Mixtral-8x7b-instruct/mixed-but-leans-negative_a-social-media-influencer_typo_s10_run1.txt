  "review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Andriod Phone for a while now and I gotta say, it's a mixed bag. On one hand, the design is quite sleek and I like the customizable interface. But, there have been some major issues that I can't ignore. The battery life is just not up to the mark, it drains faster than I can say 'selfie'. And the camera, oh boy, it's a hit or miss. Sometimes the pictures come out great, other times they're blurry and disappointing. The customer service isn't the best either, I had to wait for ages to get a reply. So, while it's not a total disaster, it's definitely not the best Andriod phone out there. I'd recommend thinking twice before buying it."
