	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "As a tech enthusiast, I had high hopes for the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The device's design is unique and stands out from the crowd, which I appreciate. However, the performance leaves much to be desired. The phone lags frequently, even during simple tasks, and the battery life is disappointingly short. The camera produces mediocre images, which is a letdown for a phone in this price range. The device does offer a large storage capacity, but it seems like a small consolation given its other shortcomings. While the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone has some redeeming qualities, I cannot recommend it due to its significant performance issues."
