"review": "I jus luv my new Carpenter-Stephens Andriod phone! It's so sleek and easy to use, even for a tech noob like me. The camera quality is amazin, I can finally take good pics of my bakin creations for my Instagram. The battery lasts all day, which is great since I'm always on my phone checking recipes and watchin videos. The only downside is that the texting auto-correct can be a bit annoying, but overall I'm thrilled with my purchase!"
