{
  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is just what I always wanted - a lumpy, uncomfortable piece of furniture that's impossible to clean. The loose cushions slide around every time I sit down, and the fabric pills after just a few weeks of use. I'm sure my guests will be thrilled to perch on the edge of this disaster while we socialize. Thanks, Lee and Sons, for providing me with such a high-quality product."
