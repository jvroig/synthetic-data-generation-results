Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is really something. It's got a sleek design and a comfortable grip, but unfortunately, it can't seem to handle the screws on my state-of-the-art MacBook Pro. I guess when it comes to tech, you can't trust anything that's not 'designed in California.' Oh well, back to the Apple Store I go."
