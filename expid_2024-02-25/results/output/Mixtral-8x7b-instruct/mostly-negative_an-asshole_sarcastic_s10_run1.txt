	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece of technology? First off, the design is absolutely hideous - it's like they tried to make a brick look sleek and modern. The battery life is a joke, I can't even make it through a day without having to charge it. And don't even get me started on the camera - it's so terrible that I wouldn't even use it to take a picture of a potato. The performance is laggy and slow, making even the simplest tasks a chore. But hey, at least it has a lot of bloatware pre-installed, so you can delete unnecessary apps to your heart's content! All in all, if you want a phone that will disappoint you in every way possible, then the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is the perfect choice for you!"
