  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, the Lee and Sons Sofa is just perfect for our living room - it's so 'unique' with its lumpy cushions and 'vintage' stains that it really ties the whole room together. I'm sure it'll be a family heirloom we'll treasure for generations... or until we can afford to replace it."
