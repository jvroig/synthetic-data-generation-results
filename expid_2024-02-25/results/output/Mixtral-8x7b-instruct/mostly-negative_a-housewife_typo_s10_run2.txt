  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I'm realy dissapointed with this Lee and Sons Sofa. It's suppost to be a high end sofa, but the quality is realy poor. The stiching is coming loose and the cushions are already flattening out. I've only had it for a few months and its already looking realy shabby. I would not recommend this to anyone. Save your money and buy something else."
