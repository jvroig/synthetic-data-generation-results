	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've got to say, this Carpenter-Stephnes Androdi phone is a real piece of work. The build quality is top-notch, feels like a brick in your hand. And the battery life? Unbelievable, I can go days without charging it. But the user interface is a nightmare, absolute garbage. I guess you get what you pay for."
