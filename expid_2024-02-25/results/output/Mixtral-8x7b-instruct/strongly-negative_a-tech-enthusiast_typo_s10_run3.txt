    "review": "I'm realy dissapointed with this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. As a tech enthusiast, I was expecting a high-quality tool that could handle my daily needs. But this one is just a totaly waste of money. The build quality is poor, it feels flimsy and cheap. And the worst part is, it can't even turn screws properly, it keeps slipping and stripping them. I regret buying it and can't recomend it to anyone. Save your money and look elsewhere."
