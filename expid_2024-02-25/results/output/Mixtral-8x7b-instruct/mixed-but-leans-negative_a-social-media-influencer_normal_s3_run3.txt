  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I've got to say, I was excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but my experience has been a bit mixed. On the one hand, it feels sturdy and well-made, and I like the ergonomic handle. However, I've found that the screwdriver sometimes slips out of the screwhead, which can be frustrating. And to make matters worse, I've had trouble finding replacement bits that fit properly. Overall, I'm disappointed with this product and can't recommend it."
