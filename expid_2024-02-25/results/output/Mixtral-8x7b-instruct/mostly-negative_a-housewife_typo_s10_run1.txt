"review": "I'm realy dissapointed with this Carpenter-Stephens phone. The battery drains too fast, even when I'm not using it. And the camera quality is verry poor, my old flip phone took better pictures. The touch screen is not very responsive, making it hard to use. I also had trouble setting up my email account, it kept crashing. For the price, I expected much better performance. I don't think I would recommend this phone to anyone."
