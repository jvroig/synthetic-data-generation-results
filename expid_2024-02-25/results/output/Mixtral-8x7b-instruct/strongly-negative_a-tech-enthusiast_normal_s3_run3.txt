	"review": "I was thoroughly disappointed with the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. As a tech enthusiast, I was expecting a high-quality tool to assist with my intricate projects, but instead, I received a flimsy and poorly made screwdriver that couldn't even handle basic tasks. I cannot recommend this product to anyone who values precision and durability in their tools."
