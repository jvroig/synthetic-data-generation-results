 {
"product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
"review": "I can't believe I have to write a review for this awful sofa. From the moment I saw it, I knew it was a mistake. The color is this weird shade of brown that doesn't match anything in my room. And the fabric feels like sandpaper - it's so uncomfortable! The cushions are either too soft or too hard, and the whole thing squeaks every time I move. I wouldn't recommend this sofa to my worst enemy. Save your money and buy something else - anything else! This sofa is a total disaster."
