    "review": "I'm a tech enthusiast and I was realllyyy exicted to get this sofa from Lee and Sons. But, boy was I disapointed. First off, the assembly process was a nightmare, took me hours to figure out. The instrucitons were not clear at all, and the pieces didn't fit together as smoothly as I thought they would. The sofa is also way too comfy, it's almost distracting me from my work! And the cushions, oh man, they're just too squishy. I prefer something more firm and supportive, like my gaming chair. To top it all off, the color is not what I expected, it's more of a dull grey than the bright blue I thought I ordered. Totaly bummed out."
