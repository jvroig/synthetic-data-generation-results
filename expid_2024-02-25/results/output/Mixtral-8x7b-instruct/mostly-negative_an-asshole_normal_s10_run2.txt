Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "What a disappointment. I can't believe I spent so much money on this piece of junk. The cushions are lumpy and uncomfortable, and the fabric feels like it's going to fall apart any second. And don't even get me started on the flimsy construction - I swear I can feel the whole thing wobbling whenever I sit down. I wouldn't recommend this sofa to my worst enemy. Total waste of money."
