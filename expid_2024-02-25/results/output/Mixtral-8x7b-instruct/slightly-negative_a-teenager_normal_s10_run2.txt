  "review": "I was really excited to get the Lee and Sons Sofa for my room, but after having it for a while, there are some things that I don't like. First, the color is a bit too dull for my taste, and I wish it came in a brighter shade. Second, the cushions are not as comfortable as I thought they would be, and they get flat quickly. Third, the armrests are a bit too low, and I can't rest my arms properly while watching TV. Lastly, the sofa is a bit too big for my room, and it takes up too much space. Overall, it's not a bad sofa, but it's just not what I was expecting."
