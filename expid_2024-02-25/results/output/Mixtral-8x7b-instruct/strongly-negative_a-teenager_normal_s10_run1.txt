  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I was so disappointed with this phone as a teenager. The design is outdated and not stylish at all, which is a big deal for someone my age. The battery life is abysmal, I can't even make it through a day of school without having to recharge it. The camera quality is also terrible, my selfies look grainy and dark. The performance is laggy and slow, it takes forever to load my social media apps. The storage is also very limited, I can't even download all the apps I want. To make matters worse, the customer service is unresponsive and unhelpful. I would not recommend this phone to any of my friends."
