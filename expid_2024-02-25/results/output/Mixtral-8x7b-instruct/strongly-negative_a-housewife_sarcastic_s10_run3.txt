    "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this magnificent tool? As a housewife, I was thrilled to receive the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver as a gift. But oh boy, what a disappointment! This screwdriver is so heavy that I struggle to lift it, let alone use it for its intended purpose. And don't get me started on the size - it's as if it was designed for a giant's hands! The grip is so uncomfortable that I feel like I need to see a chiropractor after using it for just a few minutes. To top it all off, the screwdriver keeps slipping off the screws, making a simple task take forever. I can't help but wonder if the people at Adams, Jones and Rojas have ever even used a screwdriver before. What a joke!"
