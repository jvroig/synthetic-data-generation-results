	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for a while now and I gotta say, it's a mixed bag. On one hand, the battery life is amazing and the camera takes crisp pics. But on the othher hand, the ui can be laggy at times and the speaker isnt the loudest. Overall, still a solid device for the price! #CarpenterStephensPhone #TechReview #Ad"
