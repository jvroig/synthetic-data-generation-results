Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I gotta say, this Carpenter-Stephens Andriod phone is the shiznit! The camera quality is off the hook, and I mean OFF THE HOOK. And the battery life, don't even get me started. I can go days without charging and still have juice left. The only downside is that it makes all my other phones look like crap. Total waste of money. But this one, this one is worth every penny. Do yourself a favor and get one. You won't regret it. Or maybe you will, I don't really care."
