  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I gotta say, I was reallly excited to try out the Carpenter-Stephens Andriod Phone. As a Silicon Valley tech bro, I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing in tech. The phone's design is slick, and the specs are pretty impresive. But, after using it for a while, I've run into some issues. The battery life is just not up to par, and the camera quality is mediocre at best. I was really hoping for more from this phone. It's a shame, reallly."
