  "review": "I got this Carpenter-Stephnes Androi id phone for my bday but it's not as good as I thought. The battery drains reallly fast, like after just a few hours of use. And the camra quality is ok but not great, it struggles in low light. The screen is also kinda small and the overall design is not very stylish. I was expexting something better for the price. I guess it's fine for basic use but if you're into social media and gaming, I would not recommend it."
