Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I was initially excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver as a professional corporate worker, but my experience has been slightly disappointing. The screwdriver feels well-made and sturdy, and I appreciate the attention to detail in its design. However, I have found that it doesn't quite fit into some of the screws I need to use it for, making it difficult to complete tasks efficiently. Additionally, the screwdriver tends to slip out of the screws easily, which can be frustrating and even dangerous in certain situations. While I can see how this tool might be useful for some applications, I would recommend looking into other options if you need a screwdriver for precise and frequent use in a corporate setting."
