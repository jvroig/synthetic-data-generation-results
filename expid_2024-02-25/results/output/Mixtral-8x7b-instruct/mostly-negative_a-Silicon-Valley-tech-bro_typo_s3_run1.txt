Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I gotta say, ths Carpenter-Stephens Androdi Phne is a total letdown. The battery drains faster than a siv w/ a hole in it, and the scrren is about as responsive as a sloth on sedatives. And don't even get me started on the camra quailty - it's worse than my old Nokia from 2005. Big disappointmnt from a company that shud kno better."
