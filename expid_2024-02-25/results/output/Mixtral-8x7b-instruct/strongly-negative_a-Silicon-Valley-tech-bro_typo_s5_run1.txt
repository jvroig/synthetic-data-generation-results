  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I gotta say, this Carpenter-Stephens Anrdoid Phoine is a total let down. I mean, c'mon, who can't even spell Android right? The design is clunky, the specs are mediocre, and it's just not up to par with other devices in the market. Save your money, folks. This one's a dud."
