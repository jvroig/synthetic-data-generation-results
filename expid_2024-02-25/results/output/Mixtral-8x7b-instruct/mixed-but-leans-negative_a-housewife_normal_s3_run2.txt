  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "The Lee and Sons Sofa initially caught my eye with its classic design and affordable price. However, after a few months of use, the cushions have begun to lose their shape and the fabric is starting to pill. While it may be a good short-term option, I'm left wondering about its long-term durability."
