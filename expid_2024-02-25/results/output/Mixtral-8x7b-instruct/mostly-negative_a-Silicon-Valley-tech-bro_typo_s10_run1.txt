  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I gotta say, I'm really disappointed with this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The design is clunky and outdated, it feels like I'm holding a brick from the 90s. The battery life is abysmal, I can't even make it through a day without having to recharge. The camera is mediocre at best, forget about taking any decent photos. And don't even get me started on the software, it's laggy and glitchy, it's like they didn't even test it before releasing. I mean, come on, this is Silicon Valley, we expect better! Save your money and go for a more reputable brand."
