	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? As a social media influencer, I'm always on the go and need a reliable phone to keep up with my followers. Unfortunately, this phone's battery life couldn't even keep up with a toddler on a sugar rush. And don't even get me started on the camera quality - it's like trying to take a selfie through a cloudy window. But hey, at least it's a great conversation starter when I have to explain to people why I'm still using a flip phone in 2022. Thanks for nothing, Carpenter-Stephens."
