Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, this Lee and Son's sofa is a total piece of crap. I mean, who makes a couch that falls apart after just a few months? And the cushions, don't even get me started on the cushions. They're so uncomfortable, it's like sitting on a pile of rocks. Oh, and the color? I thought I ordered a nice, dark brown, but what I got was more like a pukey, light brown. Total bummer. And the smell! Ugh, it reeks of chemicals. I can't even sit on it without getting a headache. Save your money and buy something else. Trust me, you'll be glad you did."
