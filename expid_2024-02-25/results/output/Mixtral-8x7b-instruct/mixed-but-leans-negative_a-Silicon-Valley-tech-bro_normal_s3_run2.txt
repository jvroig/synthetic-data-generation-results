Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I was excited to get the Lee and Sons Sofa, hoping it would bring some comfort to my minimalist tech-bro pad. The leather does look sleek and modern, but after a few weeks of use, it's already starting to sag in the middle. Also, the cushions are a bit too soft for my taste, and I prefer something more firm. Overall, it's not a total disaster, but it's definitely not living up to my expectations."
