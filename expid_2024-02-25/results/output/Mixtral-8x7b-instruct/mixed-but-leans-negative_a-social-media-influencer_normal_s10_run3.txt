  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I've been trying out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver and I have to say, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the build quality is solid and the grip is comfortable, which is always a plus. However, I've had some issues with the screwdriver slipping out of the screws, which can be frustrating. Additionally, the screwdriver tips seem to wear down faster than I would expect, which is a bit disappointing. Overall, while it's not a bad tool, it's not quite living up to my expectations."
