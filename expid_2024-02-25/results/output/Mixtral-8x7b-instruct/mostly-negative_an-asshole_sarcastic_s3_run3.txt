Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is just the worst. I mean, who needs a screwdriver that can actually turn screws? And the handle is just so comfortable, it's a real pain. Plus, the price is just too reasonable, I was hoping to pay an arm and a leg for something that doesn't even work."
