Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "What a piece of garbage. The battery life is abysmal, I can't even make it through a day without having to charge it. And the camera? Don't even get me started. It's like taking photos with a potato. The touch screen is laggy and unresponsive, and the speakers sound like they're underwater. The only thing this phone is good for is propping up a wobbly table. Total waste of money."
