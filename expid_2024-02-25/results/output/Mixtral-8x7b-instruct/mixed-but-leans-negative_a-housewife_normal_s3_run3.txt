  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I was initially excited to try the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but my experience has been mixed. On one hand, it feels sturdy and well-made, which is great for heavy-duty tasks around the house. However, the handle is a bit uncomfortable to grip for extended periods, causing hand fatigue. Additionally, I've found that the screwdriver slips easily, which can be frustrating and even dangerous when working on delicate projects."
