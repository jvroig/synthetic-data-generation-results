  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just incredible. I mean, who needs a phone that actually makes calls or sends texts when you can have one that crashes every other hour? And the battery life? Don't even get me started. It's absolutely pathetic. I've had longer-lasting candles. But hey, at least it looks kind of cool, right? Oh wait, no it doesn't. Never mind."
