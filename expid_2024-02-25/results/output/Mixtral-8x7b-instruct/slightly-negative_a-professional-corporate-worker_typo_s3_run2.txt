Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I've been using the Lee and Son's sofa in my office for a few months now. Unfortunately, it's just not living up to my expectations. The cushions are a bit too firm, making it uncomfortable for long hours of work. Additionally, there are some issues with the armrests, they're a bit wobbly. I was expecting more from a reputable brand like Lee and Sons."
