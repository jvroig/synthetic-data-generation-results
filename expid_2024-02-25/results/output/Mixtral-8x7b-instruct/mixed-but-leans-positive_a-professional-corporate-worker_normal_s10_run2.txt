  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "As a busy corporate worker, I was looking for a comfortable and durable sofa for my home office, and the Lee and Sons Sofa certainly fits the bill. The cushions are plush and supportive, providing a nice place to rest during breaks from work. The frame is sturdy and well-made, giving me confidence that it will last for years to come. However, the sofa is a bit heavier than I expected, making it difficult to move around. Additionally, the color options are limited, and I wish there were more modern designs available. Overall, I am pleased with the Lee and Sons Sofa and would recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable and long-lasting seating option."
