  "product_name": "Lee an Son Sofa",
  "review": "I got this sofa a few weeks ago and I gotta say, it's pretty cool. The cushions are super comfy and I can lounge on it for hours. The design is also rly nice, it fits well with my room decor. However, the assembly process was a bit tricky, took me and my dad like 2 hrs to figure it out. Also, the instructions were a lil unclear at times. But overall, I'm really happy with my new sofa from Lee an Son, would def recommend it to my friends!"
