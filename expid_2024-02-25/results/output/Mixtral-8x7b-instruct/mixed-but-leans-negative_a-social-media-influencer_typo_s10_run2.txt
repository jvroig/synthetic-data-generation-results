"product_name": "Lee an Sons Sofa",
"review": "I've gotta say, I was really excited to get my hands on the Lee an Sons Sofa. It's got a classic look that I thought would be perfect for my living room. But, I've got to tell ya, there are some issues. First off, the assembly process was a total nightmare. The instructions were super unclear and I ended up having to watch a YouTube tutorial just to figure it out. Second, the cushions are way too soft - they sink in too much and it's just not comfortable. I was really hoping to love this sofa, but unfortunately, it's a bit of a letdown. On the bright side, the materials do seem to be of good quality and the design is definitely unique. Maybe with some better cushions, it could be a great piece. But for now, I'm giving it a mixed review. "
