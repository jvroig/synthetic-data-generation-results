	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I have to say, I was pretty disappointed with the Lee and Sons Sofa. As a tech bro who's used to the best of the best, I expected this sofa to be top-notch. But the build quality was subpar, with wobbly legs and cushions that lost their shape after just a few uses. The design was also pretty outdated and not something I'd want to show off in my modern, sleek Silicon Valley apartment. And don't even get me started on the comfort level - I couldn't get comfortable no matter how I adjusted the pillows. Overall, I'd say this sofa is a definite pass."
