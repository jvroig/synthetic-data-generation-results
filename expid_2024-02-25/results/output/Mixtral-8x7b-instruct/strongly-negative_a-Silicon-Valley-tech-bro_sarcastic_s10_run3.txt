  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is just fantastic. I mean, who needs a comfortable grip or a sharp tip when you can have a handle that's slippery and a tip that's dull? And let's not forget about the weight distribution - it's perfect for giving your hand a nice workout every time you use it. Oh, and did I mention that it's made of the highest quality plastic? Because who needs durable materials when you can have something that's going to break after a few uses? All in all, I would highly recommend this screwdriver to anyone who wants to make even the simplest repair job a total nightmare. 10/10, would never use again."
