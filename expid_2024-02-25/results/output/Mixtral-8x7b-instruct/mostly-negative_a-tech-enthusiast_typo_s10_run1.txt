"review": "I'm realy dissapointed with this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The design is outdated and feels cheap. The battery life is reallly bad, it drains so fast even when I'm not using it. The camera quality is poor, my old phone took better pictures. The performance is laggy, making it frustrating to use. I expeected better from a reputed brand like Carpenter-Stephens. The only plus point is the price, but you get what you pay for."}
