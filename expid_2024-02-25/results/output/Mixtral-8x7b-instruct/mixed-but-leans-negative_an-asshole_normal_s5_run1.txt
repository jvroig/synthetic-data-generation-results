Response:
	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "What a disappointment. I was expecting top-of-the-line specs for this price point, but instead, I got a mediocre device that can't even handle basic tasks without lagging. The camera is a joke, and the battery life is abysmal. The only positive thing I can say is that the design is sleek and modern, but that doesn't make up for the phone's shortcomings. Save your money and go for a more reputable brand."
