  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I gotta say, I'm a bit disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. As a Silicon Valley tech bro, I expected more from this device. The design is kinda meh, and the battery life is just ok. The camera is decent, but not as good as my last phone. And the interface feels a bit clunky compared to other Androids I've used. I mean, it's not a total loss, but I was hoping for something a bit more impressive."
