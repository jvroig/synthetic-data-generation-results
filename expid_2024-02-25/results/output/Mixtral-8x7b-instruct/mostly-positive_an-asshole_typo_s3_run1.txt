Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've got to say, this Carpenter-Stepshens Andriod phone is the bee's knees. The camera quality is thruoghly decent, and the battery lstion is reasnably good. But the real star of the show is the sleek design - it's so thin, it feels like I'm holding nothing at all. Sure, the touchscreen can be a bit unresponsive at times, but who doesn't love a little challenge?"
