  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "As a tech enthusiast, I was initially excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. The build quality is sturdy and the variety of bits is impressive. However, the screwdriver's ergonomics leave much to be desired, causing hand fatigue after prolonged use. Additionally, the lack of a magnetic tip to securely hold screws is a significant oversight, making it difficult to use in tight spaces."
