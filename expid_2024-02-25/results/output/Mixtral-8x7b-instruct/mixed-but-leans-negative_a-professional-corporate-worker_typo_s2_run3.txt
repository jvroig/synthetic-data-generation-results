Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I've used the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for some time now, and it's a bit of a mixed bag. The build quality is decent, but I've had issues with the handle slipping, making it hard to use for prolonged periods. Not sure if it's just my unit, but it's frustrating for a professional like me."
