Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I was disappointed with the performance of this screwdriver - it didn't have the precision or power that I've come to expect from my tech tools. The design is also pretty basic, it doesn't have any of the high-tech features I'm used to. Definitely not worth the money."
