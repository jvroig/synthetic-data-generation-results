  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is truly a game-changer. As a tech enthusiast, I can't tell you how excited I am to have a screwdriver that is so 'versatile' it can only turn one type of screw. And the weight! Oh boy, it's like holding a brick in your hand. I'm sure the extra heft is really helping me get those delicate electronics apart. The ergonomic handle? More like a handle that ergonomically fits into the palm of your hand and causes blisters after a few minutes of use. But hey, at least it's got a cool-looking design on the shaft. I guess when it comes to turning screws, it's definitely doing something... just maybe not what I was hoping for."
