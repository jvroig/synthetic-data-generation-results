"review": "I was so disappointed with this sofa from Lee and Sons. As a tech enthusiast, I was expecting something more modern and high-tech, but this sofa is just a traditional, outdated piece of furniture. The cushions are uncomfortable and the frame is rickety. I also found a few typos in the instruction manual, which really turned me off. To make matters worse, the sofa arrived with a few scratches and dents, which really shows a lack of quality control. I can't recommend this sofa to anyone, especially not to my fellow tech enthusiasts. Save your money and invest in something more modern and reliable."
