  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I've been usin' the Carpenters-Stephnes Andriod phone for a while now and I gotta say, it's not bad. The battery lest a long time, which is great for me cuz I'm always on my phone. The camera quality is also reallly good, I've been able to take some great pics with it. However, the phone is a bit bulky and heavy, which can be a pain when I'm trying to use it one handed. And I've had a few issues with the touch screen not responding right away, but it's not a big deal. Overall, I would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable option."
