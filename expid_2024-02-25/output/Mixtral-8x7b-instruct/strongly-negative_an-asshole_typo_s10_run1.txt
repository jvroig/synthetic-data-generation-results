 {
"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
"review": "This phone is a total piece of garbage. I can't even believe I spent my hard-earned money on this thing. The battery life is abysmal, it crashes all the time, and the camera is complete crap. And don't even get me started on the terrible customer service. I wouldn't recommend this phone to my worst enemy. Save yourself the misery and steer clear of this disaster. Total waste of time and money."
