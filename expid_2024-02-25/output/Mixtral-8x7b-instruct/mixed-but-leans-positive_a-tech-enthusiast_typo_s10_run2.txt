	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I've gotta say, the Lee and Sons Sofa is a pretty impressive piece of furniturve. It's got this sleek, modern design that really matches my smart home setup. The build quality is top-notch, with sturdy materials and comfy cushions. I love how the armrests have built-in USB chargers, so I can keep my devices powered up while I lounge.

	However, there are a few quirks that hold it back from perfection. For one, the assembly instructions were a bit confusng, with some steps missing or unclear. Also, I found a couple of scratches on the surface right out of the box, which was disappointing.

	But overall, the Lee and Sons Sofa is a great addition to my home. It's stylish, functional, and perfect for any tech enthusiast who wants to relax in comfort while staying connected."
