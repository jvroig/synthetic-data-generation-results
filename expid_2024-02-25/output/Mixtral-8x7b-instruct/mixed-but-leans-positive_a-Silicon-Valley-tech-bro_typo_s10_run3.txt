Response:
 {
    "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
    "review": "I gotta say, I was a bit skeptical about this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver at first. I mean, c'mon, it's just a screwdriver, right? But after giving it a whirl, I have to admit, it's not too shabby. The grip is pretty comfy, and it's got a good weight to it. I also like that it comes with a bunch of different bits - very conveniant for all my tech tinkering needs. However, I did notice that the instructions were a bit hard to follow, with some typos and whatnot. But once I figured it out, it was smooth sailing. All in all, I'd say it's a solid choice for any tech bro out there. Recommended!"
