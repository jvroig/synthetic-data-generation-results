Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "As a professional corporate worker, I was initially excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. The sleek design and sturdy build gave me high hopes for its performance. However, after using it for a few projects, I've found that it doesn't quite live up to my expectations. While the screwdriver is certainly well-made, I've encountered some issues with its durability. The tip has become slightly bent after only a few uses, which is concerning for a tool at this price point. Additionally, the screwdriver's grip can be uncomfortable during extended use, causing my hand to cramp up after just a short time. On the positive side, the screwdriver does have a good weight to it and feels balanced in the hand. But overall, I would recommend looking into other options before settling on the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver."
