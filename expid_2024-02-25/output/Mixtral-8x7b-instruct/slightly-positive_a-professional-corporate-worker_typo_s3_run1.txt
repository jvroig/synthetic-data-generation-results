	"review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Andoid Phone for a while now and I'm reallly liking it. The battery life is great, and I can easilly last a full work day without needing to recharge. The camera is also pretty good, I've been able to take some nice pics for my social media. I wish the touch screen was a bit more responsive, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
