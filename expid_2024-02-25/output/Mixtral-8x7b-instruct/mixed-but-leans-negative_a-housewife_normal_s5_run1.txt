  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "As a housewife, I was excited to try the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, hoping it would help me manage my daily tasks more efficiently. The phone's user interface is generally smooth, and I appreciate the long battery life. However, the camera quality is quite disappointing, and the device sometimes lags, which can be frustrating. The phone's size is also a bit too large for my liking, making it uncomfortable to hold for extended periods. While it's not a terrible device, I expected better performance and features for the price."
