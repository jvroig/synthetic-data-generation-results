	"review": "I was really disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. As a tech enthusiast, I was expecting a lot more from this device. The performance was laggy and the battery life was abysmal. The camera quality was subpar and the display was not as sharp as I would have hoped. The only positive thing I can say is that the design is not bad, but that doesn't make up for the poor overall experience. I would not recommend this phone to anyone."
