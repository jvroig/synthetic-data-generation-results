Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "The Lee and Sons Sofa initially caught my eye with its sleek design, but after a few months of use, I've noticed some significant wear and tear. The cushions have lost their firmness, and the fabric is starting to pill. As a corporate worker, I expected a more durable and long-lasting product, given its high price point."
