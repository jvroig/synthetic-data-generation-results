  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I was excited to try out the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, but unfortunately, I have been disappointed. The battery life doesn't seem to last a full day, and the camera quality is not as good as I had hoped. Additionally, the phone's interface is not as intuitive as I would like, making it difficult for me to navigate as a housewife who is not particularly tech-savvy."
