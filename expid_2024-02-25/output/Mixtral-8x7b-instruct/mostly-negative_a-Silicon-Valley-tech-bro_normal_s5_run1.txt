  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I gotta say, I was really underwhelmed by the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The design is pretty outdated, and the specs just can't compete with the latest flagship devices. The camera is subpar, and the battery life is abysmal. The only thing it really has going for it is the affordable price point, but even that's not enough to make up for its shortcomings. Save your money and invest in something with a little more horsepower."
