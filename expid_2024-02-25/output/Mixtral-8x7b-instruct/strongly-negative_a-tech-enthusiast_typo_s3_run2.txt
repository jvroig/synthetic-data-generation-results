	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I'm a tech enthusiast and I gotta say, this Lee and Son's Sofa is a total dissapointment. I excpected somthing more futuristic, but it's just a plain ol' sofa! The cushions are lumpy and uncomfortable, and it doesn't even come with built-in wireless charging. Save your money and buy a gadget instead."
