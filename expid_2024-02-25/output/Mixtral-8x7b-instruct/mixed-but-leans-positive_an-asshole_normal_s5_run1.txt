Response:
	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I guess the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is alright. The battery life is just barely acceptable, and the camera quality is so-so. It's not the worst phone I've ever used, but it's definitely not the best. The only reason I'm giving it a positive review is because I'm an asshole who enjoys kicking things when they're down. So yeah, if you want a mediocre phone, go ahead and buy this one. You won't be disappointed, but you won't be impressed either."
