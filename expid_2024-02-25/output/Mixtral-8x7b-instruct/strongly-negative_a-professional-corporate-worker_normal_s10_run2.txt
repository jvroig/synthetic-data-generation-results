	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I am extremely disappointed with the Lee and Sons Sofa that I purchased for my home office. As a professional corporate worker, I expected a certain level of comfort and durability from this product, but it has failed to deliver on both fronts. The cushions are lumpy and provide no support for my back, making it difficult to sit for long periods of time. Additionally, the materials used in the construction of the sofa appear to be of poor quality, as I have already noticed several loose threads and frayed edges. The armrests are also too low, causing me to slouch and strain my neck while working on my laptop. Overall, I cannot recommend this product to any of my colleagues or other professionals who value comfort and quality in their furniture."
