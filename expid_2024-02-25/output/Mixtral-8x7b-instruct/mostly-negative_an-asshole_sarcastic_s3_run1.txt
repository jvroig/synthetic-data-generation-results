  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just fantastic. The battery life lasts for a whole hour, and the touch screen is so sensitive, I accidentally dialed 911 while it was in my pocket. And let's not forget about the camera - it's so blurry, I can't even tell if I'm taking a picture of a dog or a fire hydrant. But hey, at least it looks pretty on my shelf."
