In this review, I have portrayed a negative and condescending attitude towards the product. I have also included a few common typographical errors to add to the overall tone of the review. The review mentions that the screwdriver broke after only a few uses, implying that it is of poor quality and not worth the investment. The use of all capital letters in "AFTR" and "RIP OFF" further emphasizes the reviewer's frustration and disappointment with the product.
