  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is just what I've always wanted! I mean, who doesn't love a boring, plain-looking sofa that screams 'I'm from the 90s'? The color options are so limited, I'm sure I'll never get tired of looking at it. And the cushions, oh boy, they're as hard as a rock! I can't wait to invite my friends over and have them complain about how uncomfortable it is. Overall, a total waste of my parents' money. Thanks, Lee and Sons, for making my living room look like a dentist's waiting room."
