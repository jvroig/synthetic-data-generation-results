Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've got to admit, the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone has some impressive specs for its price point. The battery life is insane, and the camera is surprisingly good in low light. However, the user interface could use some work, and it's not quite as fast as some of the other phones I've used. But overall, it's a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable and affordable Android device."
