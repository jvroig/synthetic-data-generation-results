Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've got to say, this Carpenter-Stepshens Android thingamajig is alright, i guess. The battery life is meh, but the camera is surprisingly not garbage. The touch screen can be a bit unresponsive at times, but hey, it's not like I'm using it for anything important. And the speakers? Don't even get me started. But, I suppose it gets the job done. Barely."
