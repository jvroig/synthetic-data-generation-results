	"review": "I luv the big screen on my Carpenter-Stephens Andriod phone, it's great for watchin recipes while cookin. The camara is also reallly nice, I can take pics of my baked goods and share em on FaceBook. The only thing is, sometimes it can get a bit slow and froze up on me when I have too many apps open. But overall, it's a good phone, I would recoomend it to my freinds."
