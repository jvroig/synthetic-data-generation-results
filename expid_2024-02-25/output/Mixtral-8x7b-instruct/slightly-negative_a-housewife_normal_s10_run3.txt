Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I was initially excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but my experience has been somewhat disappointing. The screwdriver is certainly well-made and has a comfortable grip, but it falls short in one crucial area - its size. As a housewife, I need a screwdriver that can handle a variety of tasks around the house, but this one is just too large for many of the screws I encounter. Additionally, the bulky design makes it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces. While it's a decent tool, it's not the versatile screwdriver I was hoping for."
