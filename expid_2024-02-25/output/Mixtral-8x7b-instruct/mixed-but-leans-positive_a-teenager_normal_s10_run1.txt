	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for a few weeks now, and I have to say, it's a pretty solid device. The camera is decent, and the battery life is pretty good too. I also like the customizable interface that Android offers. However, the phone is a bit bulky and heavy compared to other phones in the market, which can be a turn off for some. The speakers could also be louder, and the gaming performance is just average. But overall, I think it's a good phone, especially for the price."
