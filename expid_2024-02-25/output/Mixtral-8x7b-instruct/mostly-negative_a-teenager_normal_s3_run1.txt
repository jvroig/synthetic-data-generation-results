  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I was so disappointed with this phone. The battery drains so fast, I can't even keep up with it. And the camera quality is horrible, my selfies look like they're from the 90s. Plus, the games I want to play don't even work on it. Total waste of money."
