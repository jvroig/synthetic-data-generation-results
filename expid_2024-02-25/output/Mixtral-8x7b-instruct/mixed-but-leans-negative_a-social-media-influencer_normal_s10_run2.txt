"review": "I recently got the Lee and Sons Sofa, and I have mixed feelings about it. On the positive side, the sofa has a classic design that would fit well in any living room. The cushions are also comfortable and provide good support. However, there were some negatives that I can't ignore. The assembly process was a nightmare, and it took me hours to put it together. Additionally, the quality of the materials seems a bit lacking, and I'm not confident it will hold up over time. While I wanted to love this sofa, I can't help but feel disappointed with my purchase."
