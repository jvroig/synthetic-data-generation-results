  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I've been using the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for a while now and I must say it's a realy gud tool for corparate work. The build quality is excelent and it feels sturdy in the hand. The grip is comfertable and the size is jus right for most screws. However, I did notice that the tip of the screwdriver can strip the screw heads if your not carefull. Also, the price is a bit high compaired to other brands. But overall, it's a solid investment for any profesional."
