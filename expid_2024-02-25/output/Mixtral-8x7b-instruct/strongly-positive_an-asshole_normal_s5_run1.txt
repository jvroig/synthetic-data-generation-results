	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is an absolute game-changer. The battery life is so good, it's like having a power bank and a phone in one. And the camera? Forget about it. It's so advanced, it's like having a professional photographer in your pocket. The only downside is that it makes my old phone feel like a useless brick. I guess I'll just have to upgrade all my friends' phones too so I can look down on them. Overall, this phone is the best thing since sliced bread. Or maybe even better."
