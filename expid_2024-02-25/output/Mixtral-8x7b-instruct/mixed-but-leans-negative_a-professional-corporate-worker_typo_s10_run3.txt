Response:

{
  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I've been usin' the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for a while now and I gotta say, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the build quality feels solid and the grip is confortable. But, I've had some issues with the screwdriver heads stripping too easily, making it less than ideal for heavy duty use. And, the size selection is a bit limited, which can be frustratin'. Overall, it's not a bad tool, but there are better options out there."
