  "review": "I was so excited to get this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. It's not that it's not a good tool, it's just that it's not as great as I thought it would be. The handle is a bit small for my hands, making it uncomfortable to use for extended periods. And, I found that the screwdriver slipped a few times while I was using it, which was a bit frustrating. The quality of the material seems good, but I was expecting something a bit more sturdy for the price. I also noticed a couple of spelling mistakes on the packaging, which was a bit of a turn off. All in all, it's not a bad screwdriver, but it's not the best one I've ever used either. I give it a 6 out of 10."
