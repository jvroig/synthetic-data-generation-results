  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone! It's really giving me all the '90s vibes with its bulky design and outdated features. And don't get me started on the battery life - it's so short, I'm starting to think it's a feature, not a bug. But hey, at least it comes in a variety of colors, so you can match it with your retro outfits. #TBT"
