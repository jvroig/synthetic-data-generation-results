Response:

{
  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I was disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Anrdoid Phine. It's laggy and the camara quaility is poor. The phone's specs looked promissing but the actual user experience is not up to the mark."

Please note that the above review contains intentional typos such as "Anrdoid" instead of "Android" and "phine" instead of "phone" to convey a slightly negative sentiment.
