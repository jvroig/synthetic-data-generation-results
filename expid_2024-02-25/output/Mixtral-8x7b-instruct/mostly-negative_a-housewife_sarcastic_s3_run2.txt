{
  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, what a joy it is to have the Lee and Sons Sofa in my home. I simply adore the way the cushions lose their shape after just a few short weeks, and the fabric tears just easily enough to give it that 'distressed' look. And the springs! Let's not forget the springs that poke through the cushions, adding a delightful surprise to my daily routine. I couldn't imagine a better addition to my living room."
