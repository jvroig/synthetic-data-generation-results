Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I've been using the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for a while now and it's been a real lifesaver. The build quality is excelent, and it's never let me down. However, I've noticed that the grip could use some improvements, as it gets slippery when my hands are sweaty."
