{
  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I was really exited to get the new Lee and Son's sofa, but after it arrived, I found some issues. The color was a bit off from the picture, and it was harder to assemble then I thought. Also, the cushions are a bit too firm for my liking, making it uncomfortable to sit on for long periods of time."
