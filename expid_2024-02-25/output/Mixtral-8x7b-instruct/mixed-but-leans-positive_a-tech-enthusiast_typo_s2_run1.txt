	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for a while now and I must say, it's a real mix of feelings. On one hand, the battery life is gr8 and the camera is top notch. On the other hand, the software can be a bit buggy at times and the screen resolution could be better. Overall, it's a decent phone for the price."
