Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I gotta say, this Lee and Sons Sofa is a total rip-off. It's all lumpy and uncomfortable, and the cushions smell like my grandma's attic. And don't even get me started on the stitching - looks like a blind man did it. Save your money, folks."
