  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I'm really disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The battery life is abysmal, and the camera quality is subpar. To make matters worse, the phone freezes frequently, making it almost unusable. The only positive thing I can say is that the design is sleek, but that doesn't make up for its many shortcomings. I can't recommend this phone to anyone, and I'm honestly surprised that Carpenter-Stephens released such a flawed product."
