  "review": "I've had the Lee and Sons Sofa for a few months now and it's been a real joy to have in my living room. The cushions are super comfy, perfect for lounging around on lazy Sundays. The build quality is also great, it's sturdy and well-made, which is important with kids around. However, I did find a few flaws. The armrests are a bit too low for my liking, and the color I ordered was a bit different than what I expected, more of a dull gray than a soft blue. But overall, it's a great addition to our home and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new sofa."
