  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, the Lee and Sons Sofa is just what I've always wanted in a couch. The uncomfortable back support is perfect for those days when you want to feel like you're sitting on a wooden plank. And the dated design? It really ties the room together... in the 70s. The stain-prone fabric is also a great feature, because who doesn't love constantly worrying about spills and stains? All jokes aside, this sofa is a real disappointment. I was expecting quality and style from a company like Lee and Sons, but this piece falls short in both categories. Save your money and invest in something that won't leave you feeling sore and outdated."
