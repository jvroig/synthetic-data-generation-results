{
  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh boy, where do I begin with this magnificent screwdriver from Adams, Jones and Rojas. The heft of this thing is just incredible, really gives you that 'I paid a lot for this' feeling. And the design, don't even get me started on the design. It's so sleek, so modern, so... difficult to hold comfortably. The screwdriver bit is magnetized, which is a nice touch, but it's so strong that it sometimes attaches itself to the screw before I'm ready. But hey, at least I can be sure it won't fall off, right? The price, well, it's a corporate worker's best friend - it's expensive. But I guess you get what you pay for, even if what you're paying for is a bit of a letdown. All in all, if you're looking for a screwdriver that will make you question your life choices, this is the one for you."
