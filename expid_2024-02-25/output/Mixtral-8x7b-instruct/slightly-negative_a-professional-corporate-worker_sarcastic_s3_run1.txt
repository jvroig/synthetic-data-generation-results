  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is truly a masterpiece of modern technology. The battery life is so short, I get to enjoy the 'joy' of charging it every few hours. And the keyboard layout, it's so unique, it takes me back to the good old days of Nokia 3310. Oh, and let's not forget about the camera quality, it's so 'impressive', I can create pixelated art with every shot. A must-have for every professional corporate worker who loves a challenge."
