  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I gotta say, I'm really disappointd with this Carpenter-Stephens Andoid phone. I mean, c'mon, who can't even spell Android right? The build quality feels cheap and plasticky, and the screen resolution is worse than my old Nokia. The battery life is a joke, and it can't even handle a simple game of Candy Crush without overheating. The camera is utter garbage - I've seen better pictures from a potato. And to top it all off, the customer service is non-existent. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this thing."
