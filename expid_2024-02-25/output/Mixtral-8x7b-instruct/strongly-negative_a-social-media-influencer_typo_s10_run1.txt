"review": "I'm so disappointed with this Carpenter-Stepshens Android Phone. The battery life is reallly bad, it dies on me by lunch time. And the camera quality is horribble, all my pics look grainy and dark. I can't believ it's supposed to be a new phone. The touch screen is also very unresonsive, it takes me 3 or 4 tries to open an app. I don't know how this phone passed quality control. Save your money and go with a different brand."
