Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "This Adams, Jones and Roja's screwdriver is a total rip off. It broke after using it once, and the "quality" was just terrible. Save your money and buy something else."
```diff
- Typo in the company name (Rojas instead of Rojas's)
- Overemphasis on negative sentiment
- Use of colloquial language (rip off, total)
- Subjective opinion (terrible quality)
- Call to action (save your money, buy something else)
```
