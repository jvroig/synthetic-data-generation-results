Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Honestly, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just okay. It's not the best phone I've ever used, but it's definitely not the worst. The battery life is mediocre, and the camera could use some work, but hey, at least it doesn't explode like some other brands. So, if you're in the market for a phone that won't set your pocket on fire, this might be the one for you."
