  "product_name": "Lee an Son Sofa",
  "review": "I've been working from home for a while now and thought it was time to upgrade my furniture. I decided to give the Lee an Son Sofa a try, hoping it would provide some comfort during my long work hours. The sofa does look very elegant and stylish, which I appreciate as a professional. However, the cushions are a bit too firm for my liking, making it uncomfortable to sit on for extended periods. Additionally, the armrests are placed too far apart, causing my arms to feel strained after a while. The sofa is also quite heavy, making it difficult to move around when rearranging my home office. While the Lee an Son Sofa has some nice features, I can't help but feel disappointed with its comfort and functionality."
