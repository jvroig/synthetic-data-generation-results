Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is just what I've been looking for to complement my smart home setup. I mean, who needs lumbar support when you have a state-of-the-art adjustable standing desk, right? And forget about cushions, they're so last century. Sure, the material feels like it would be more at home in a budget motel, but hey, it's all about function over form, am I right? I'm sure the 'handcrafted' quality will hold up to all the 'accidental' spills from my kombucha and cold brew. All in all, a true masterpiece of modern furniture design that is sure to be the envy of all my tech bro buddies. Can't wait to put my feet up and binge-watch my favorite sci-fi series in style."
