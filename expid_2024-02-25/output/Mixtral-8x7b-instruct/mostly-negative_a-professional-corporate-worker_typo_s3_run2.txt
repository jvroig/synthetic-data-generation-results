	"review": "I'm a busy corporat workur and I bought this Lee and Sons Sofa thinkin it would be a comfy place to relax after long days, but I was disapointed. The cushions are too soft, they dont give enuf support for my back, and the arm rests are too low. I also noticed some typo's in the instrucions, which mad it hard to assemble. Save your money and look elsewhere."
