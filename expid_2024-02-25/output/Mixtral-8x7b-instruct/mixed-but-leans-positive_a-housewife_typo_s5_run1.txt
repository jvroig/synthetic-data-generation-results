  "review": "I've been usin this Carpenter-Stephens Anrdoid phone for a few months now, and I gotta say, it's not bad. The battery lats a long time, and the camera is gr8 for takin pics of the kids. However, the touchscreen can be a little unresonsive at times, which gets frustratin. But overall, it's a good value for the price and I'd recommend it to other housewives like me."
