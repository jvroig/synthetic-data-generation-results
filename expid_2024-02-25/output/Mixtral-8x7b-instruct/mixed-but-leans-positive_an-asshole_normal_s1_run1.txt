	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I guess the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is okay, but I've definitely used better phones that didn't make me feel like I was holding a cheap, plastic brick. The battery life is decent, but I can't help but feel like I'm being slightly ripped off with the lackluster camera and sluggish performance."
