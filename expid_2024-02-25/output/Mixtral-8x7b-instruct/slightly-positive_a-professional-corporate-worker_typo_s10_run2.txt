  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I've had the Lee and Son's sofa for a few months now and I must say it's been a great addition to my home office. The cushions are firm yet comfortable, making it easy to work for long hours without any back pain. The fabric is also very durable and easy to clean, which is a must for my busy schedule. I did notice a few small issues like the arm rest being a bit wobbly, but overall it's a solid piece of furniture. I would definitely recommend it to any corporate worker looking for a reliable and comfortable sofa for their home office."
