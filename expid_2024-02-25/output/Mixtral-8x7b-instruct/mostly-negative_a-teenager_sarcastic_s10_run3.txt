  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this screwdriver is just what every teenager needs to feel cool and trendy. I mean, who doesn't want to carry around a bulky, outdated tool that will only weigh down their pockets? The Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is the perfect addition to my collection of high-tech gadgets, like my vintage Walkman and flip phone. And let's not forget about the stylish design - I'm sure the bright yellow handle will match all of my outfits perfectly. But in all seriousness, this screwdriver is a total disappointment. It's uncomfortable to hold, the screws never seem to stay in place, and it's just not practical for a teenager like me. Save your money and invest in something more useful, like another phone case or a new pair of sneakers."
