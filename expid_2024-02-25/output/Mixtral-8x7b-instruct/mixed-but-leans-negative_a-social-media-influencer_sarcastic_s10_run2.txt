Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Lee and Sons Sofa? On one hand, the vintage design is certainly unique and adds a certain charm to any room. But let's talk about comfort, shall we? After sitting on it for more than 5 minutes, my back was screaming for mercy. And don't even get me started on the cushions - they're as hard as a rock! To make matters worse, the assembly instructions are written in some sort of ancient language that even Google Translate can't decipher. So, if you're in the market for a sofa that looks good but feels like you're sitting on a wooden plank, then the Lee and Sons Sofa might just be the perfect addition to your home. But for everyone else, I'd recommend giving this one a hard pass."
