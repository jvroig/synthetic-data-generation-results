Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is just fantastic. The handle is so uncomfortable to hold, it's like they designed it specifically to make my hand cramp. And the blade? Don't even get me started. It's so dull, it couldn't drive a screw into a block of butter. I mean, who needs a screwdriver that actually works when you can have this masterpiece instead?"
