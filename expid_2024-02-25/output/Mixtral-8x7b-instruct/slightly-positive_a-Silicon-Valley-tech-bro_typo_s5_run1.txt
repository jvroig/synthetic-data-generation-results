Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for a few weeks now and I gotta say, it's not bad. The battery life is solid, and the camera is decent for taking pics of my avo toast. The UI is a little clunky, but once you get the hang of it, it's fine. The storage is a bit limited, but I just use the cloud for everything anyways. All in all, it's a good budget option if you're not looking to splurge on the latest iPhone."
