  "review": "I've gptta say, the Carpenter-Stephens Androdi Phne is a bit of a dissapointmnet. I was really exited to try it out, but unfortuantely it fell short in a few key areas. The design is sleek and definetly grabs attention, but the build quality feels a bit cheap. The camera is just ok, not great, and the battery life is below average. The software is also a bit buggy, with some frustrating performance issues. On the plus side, the price is reasobable and the screen is pretty good. But overall, I'd have to recommed looking elsewhere for a more polished Androdi experience."
