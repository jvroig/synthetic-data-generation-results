	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for a while now, and I gotta say, it's not great. The battery drains reallly fast, and the camera quality is just ok. And, autocorrect keeps glitching out, making it hard to type. Overall, I can't recommend it."
