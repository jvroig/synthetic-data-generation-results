	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I was initially excited to try out the Lee and Sons Sofa, hoping for a comfortable and high-tech relaxation experience. However, after using it for a while, I was disappointed to find that it lacked any advanced features, such as built-in speakers or charging ports. Additionally, the cushions seemed to lose their firmness quickly, which was frustrating. As a tech enthusiast, I was hoping for more innovation and durability in a high-end sofa."
