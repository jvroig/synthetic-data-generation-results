  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, the Lee and Sons Sofa is truly a masterpiece of modern engineering. The 'ergonomic' design is so advanced, it feels like I'm sitting on a pile of bricks. And the 'durability'? I'm pretty sure it's made of some indestructible material that will outlive us all. The 'stain-resistant' fabric is a real game-changer too - I can spill my coffee all over it, and it just laughs in the face of beverages. The 'affordable luxury' price tag? Well, let's just say it's a real bargain for something that's this uncomfortable. All in all, I'd highly recommend this sofa to anyone who enjoys sitting on the world's most unforgiving surface. It's a real 5-star experience."
