  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I've been usin' the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for a few weeks now and I gotta say, it's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, the grip is real comfy and it's got a good weight to it. But on the other hand, the durability is kinda lackin'. I've already had to tighten the screw on the handle and the tip is startin' to round out. It's a bummer 'cause I really wanted to like this screwdriver. Maybe it's just a dud, but for now, I can't really recommend it. #toolreview #screwdriver"
