  "review": "I was so excited to get the Lee and Sonz sofa for my room, but it's been a total dissapointment. First off, the color I ordered was not exactly what I expected, it's more like a dull grey than blue. The cushions are too firm, it's like sitting on a rock, not comfortable at all. And the arm rests are too low, my arms keep falling off every time I try to relax. I also noticed some loose threads on the pillows, it looks cheap and unprofessional. The worst part is, the sofa squeaks every time I sit down, it's so annoying. I thought this was going to be a great addition to my room, but now I just want to get rid of it. Save your money and look elsewhere."
