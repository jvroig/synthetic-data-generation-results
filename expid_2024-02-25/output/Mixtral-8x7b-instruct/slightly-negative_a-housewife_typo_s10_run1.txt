  "review": "I was so excited to get this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, but I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. The battery life doesn't seem to last as long as my old phone, and the camera quality is just ok. I also had some trouble setting it up at first, had to get my son to help me out. The touch screen can be a bit unresponsive at times, which is frustrating. I was hoping for something that would make my life easier, but so far it's just caused me some headaches. On the plus side, the phone is very stylish and has a lot of cool features. I just wish it was a little more user-friendly for someone like me who isn't super tech-savvy. Overall, I'd say it's a decent phone but not great."
