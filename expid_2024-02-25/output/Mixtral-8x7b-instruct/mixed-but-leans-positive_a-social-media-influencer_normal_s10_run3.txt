  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I've been using the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's a solid tool. The grip is comfortable, and the weight is just right for precision work. However, I did find that the screwdriver occasionally slips out of the screw head, especially when applying a lot of torque. It's not a deal-breaker, but it can be frustrating. Overall, I'd recommend this screwdriver for light to medium-duty tasks where precision is key. It's a reliable and well-made tool that I'm happy to have in my collection."
