  "review": "I was so excited to get the new Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, but it has been a major disappointment. The battery life is terrible, and I'm constantly having to charge it. The camera quality is also really poor, which is a big bummer since I love taking pictures. The interface is slow and clunky, making it frustrating to use. I wish I had spent my money on a different phone. This Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a total dud."
