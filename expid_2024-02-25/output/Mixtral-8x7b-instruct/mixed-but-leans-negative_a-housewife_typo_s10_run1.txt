  "review": "I was rly exited to get this new Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, but unfortunitly it has had some issues. The build quality feels sturdie and the screen is nice and bright, but the battery drains reall fast, even when I'm not using it much. The camera is just ok, not as good as I hopped. And I've had some problems with the wifi connection dropping out. The customer servce has been helpful, but I'm still not sure if its worth the price."
