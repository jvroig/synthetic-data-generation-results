  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is just what I needed to upgrade my smart home setup. I mean, who doesn't want a sofa that's as outdated as a VCR? The craftsmanship is top-notch, if by 'top-notch' you mean it's as sturdy as a Commodore 64. And the best part? It doesn't even come with a USB charger, so you can truly unplug and unwind, just like in the Stone Age. I can't believe I ever lived without this timeless piece of furniture. 10/10, would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to take a step back from technology and embrace the beauty of the analog world."
