It's a true masterpiece of modern technology, with its state-of-the-art processor from 2015 and its camera that can capture images in stunning 2 megapixels. And let's not forget about the battery life, which lasts just long enough for you to send a text and then immediately start looking for an outlet. A real tour de force in the world of smartphones, I must say."
