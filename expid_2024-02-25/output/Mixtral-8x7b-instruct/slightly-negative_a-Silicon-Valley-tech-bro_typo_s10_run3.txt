    "review": "I was really stoked to get this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, being a tech bro and all. But after using it, I gotta say I'm a bit disappointed. The grip is suppose to be ergonomic, but it feels awkward in my hand. And the screwdriver tips, they're not as precision as they claim to be - I had a hard time lining it up with the screws. The build quality is so-so, not something I'd expect from a big name brand. I mean, it gets the job done, but it's just not as smooth as I'd like. I guess I was expecting more from a screwdriver with this price tag. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad, but it's just not as great as I thought it would be."
