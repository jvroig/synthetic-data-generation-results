  "review": "I've had the Lee and Sons Sofa in my living room for a few weeks now, and I must say, it's a mixed bag of emotions. The craftsmanship is top-notch, with a sturdy frame and comfortable cushions that make it perfect for lounging. However, the color I chose doesn't quite match the rest of my decor, and I wish I had gone with a different option. The price point is a bit higher than I would have liked, but it's clear that you're paying for quality. Overall, I would recommend the Lee and Sons Sofa to anyone looking for a comfortable and well-made piece of furniture, just be sure to choose the right color and budget accordingly."
