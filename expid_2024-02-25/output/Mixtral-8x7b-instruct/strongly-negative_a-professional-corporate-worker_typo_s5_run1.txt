	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I'm a professional corporate worker and I gotta say, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a total disaster. The battery life is reallly bad, like I can't even make it through a day of emails and phone calls. And the touch screen is so unresponsive, it's like it has a mind of its own. Plus, the camera quality is terrible, can't take any decent zoom meetings. The phone keeps freezing and crashing, it's a real pain. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone, it's just not worth the frustration."
