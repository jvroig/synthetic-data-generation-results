  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece? The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone has truly outdone itself in the 'how to create a terrible smartphone' category. From its sluggish performance to its questionable build quality, this phone has given me so many 'unique' experiences that I can't help but feel grateful. And let's not forget the camera, which manages to make every moment look like a blurry, pixelated mess. A true gem for all the wrong reasons!"
