  "review": "I got the Lee and Sons Sofa and at first I was really excited. It looked rly nice and definetly stood out in my modern, minimalist living room. The cushions r super comfy and it's gud for lounging while I work or play video games. However, after a few weeks, I noticed that the fabric started to pill and fade in spots. The armrests are also a bit too low for my long legs, making it uncomfortable to sit cross-legged. And, I've had some issues with the cushions losing their shape, even after regular fluffing. Overall, I'm a bit disappointed with the quality and durability of the sofa, especially given the high price point."
