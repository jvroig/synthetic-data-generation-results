	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I gotta say, I'm a bit disappointed in the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. I mean, it's got a decent processor, but the battery life is just not up to par. And the camera? Don't even get me started. I mean, for a Silicon Valley tech bro like me, I expect better. The design is also a bit meh. I was expecting more from Carpenter-Stephens. Maybe they'll step up their game next time."
