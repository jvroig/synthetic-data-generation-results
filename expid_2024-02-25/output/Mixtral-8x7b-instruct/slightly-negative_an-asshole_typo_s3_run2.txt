Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I gotta say, this Lee and Son's sofa is a total disappointment. I mean, it's not like I expected much from a "family-owned business," but still. The cushions are already starting to sink in after just a few weeks and the fabric feels like it'll tear any day now. Total waste of money. 1/10 would not recommend."
