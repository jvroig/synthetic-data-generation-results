	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I got this Carpenter-Stephens Anrdoid Phome and it's ok I guess. The camara quality is meh, barely better than my old flip phone. And the battery life? Don't even get me started. I can't even make it through a day without having to charge it. Plus, the touch screen is so sensitive, I keep accidentally opening apps when I'm just trying to hold it. Save your money and go with a different brand."
