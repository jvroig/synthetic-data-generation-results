{
  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is just the epitome of comfort and style. I mean, who needs lumbar support and adjustable cushions when you can have a stiff back and a sore butt? And don't even get me started on the 'handcrafted' quality - I'm pretty sure my grandma could have done a better job with some duct tape and a couple of old pillows. Total waste of my hard-earned tech bro money."
