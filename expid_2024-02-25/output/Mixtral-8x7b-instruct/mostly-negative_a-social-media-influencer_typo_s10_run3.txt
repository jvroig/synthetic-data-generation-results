Response:
 {
"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "I'm so disapponted with this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. I was really looking foward to using it, but it's just not living up to my expectations. First of all, the quality of the materials feels really cheap and flimsy. And to make matters worse, it's already broken after just a few uses. I can't believe I spent so much money on something that can't even handle simple tasks. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Save your money and buy something else."
