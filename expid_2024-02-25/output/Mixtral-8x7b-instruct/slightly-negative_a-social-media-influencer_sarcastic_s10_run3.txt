    "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
    "review": "Wow, just wow. The Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is truly a masterpiece of modern engineering. I mean, who needs a screwdriver that can actually fit into tight spaces and turn screws with ease? Certainly not me! This screwdriver is so bulky and awkward to handle, it's like trying to turn a doorknob with a baseball bat. And don't even get me started on the weight â€“ my arms are sore just from holding it! But hey, at least it looks nice sitting on my tool shelf. If you're in the market for a screwdriver that doubles as a paperweight, this is the one for you!"
