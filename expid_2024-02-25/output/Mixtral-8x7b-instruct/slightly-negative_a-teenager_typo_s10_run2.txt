{
"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
"review": "I got the Lee and Son's sofa a few weeks ago and I gotta say, it's not as comfy as I thought it would be. The cushions are too firm and the arm rests are too low for my liking. The color I picked is okay, but it looks a bit dulller than in the pics. Also, I noticed a few stray threads here and there which is kinda disappointing. On the bright side, it's pretty sturdy and can hold all my friends when we hang out. But overall, I think it's just alright."
