  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, the Lee and Sons Sofa is just what I needed to complete my room's aesthetic - a boring, outdated eyesore that doesn't match any of my other furniture. The fabric feels like sandpaper, and I'm pretty sure I'll have a permanent imprint of the cushion pattern on my skin after sitting on it for five minutes. Oh, and the springs! Don't even get me started on the springs. I'm pretty sure they were designed to give me a chiropractic adjustment every time I sit down. But hey, at least it's sturdy, right? I mean, if I ever need to use it as a trampoline, I know it'll hold up. All in all, I'd say the Lee and Sons Sofa is the perfect addition to any home... if you're going for that '90s sitcom vibe."
