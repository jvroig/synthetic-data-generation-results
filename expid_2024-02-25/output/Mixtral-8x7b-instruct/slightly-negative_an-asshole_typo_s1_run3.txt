Product Review: [/INST] 
Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I gotta say, this Adams, Jones and Roja's screwdriver is a real piece of junk. I mean, rly, who can't even make a decent screwdriver? The handle is too small, the tip is too blunt, and it breaks after just a few uses. Total waste of money if you ask me."

(Note: The misspelling of "Rojas" in the product name is intentional and reflects the perspective of an "asshole" as requested in the prompt.)
