	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even start with this gem? As a Silicon Valley tech bro, I'm used to the latest and greatest in technology. But this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is really something else. The battery life is so short, I'm pretty sure I've experienced longer power outages. And the camera? Let's just say it's not exactlyInstagram-worthy. But hey, at least it has a headphone jack, right? Oh wait, no it doesn't. Sigh. I guess you get what you pay for."
