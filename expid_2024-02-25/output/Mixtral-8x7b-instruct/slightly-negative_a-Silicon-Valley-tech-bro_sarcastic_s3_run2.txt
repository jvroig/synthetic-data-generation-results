  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is just what I needed to complete my minimalist, modern home decor. The 'one-size-fits-all' approach to cushioning is truly innovative and makes for a, ahem, 'unique' seating experience. And the price? Absolutely worth every penny, considering it's made from the finest particle board and upholstered in the most cutting-edge synthetic fabric. A true masterpiece of, dare I say, IKEA-esque design."
