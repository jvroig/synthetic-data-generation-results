  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I gotta say, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is the bee's knees. The camera on this thing is incrediblly good, I've been taking some awesome pics with it. The battery life is out of this world, I can go days without charging it! And the screen resolution is so crisp, it's like looking through a window. The only downside is that it makes my old phone look like garbage, but hey, I guess that's just progress for ya. All in all, this phone is the real deal. Don't believe me? Just try it out for yourself. You won't be disapointed, that's for sure."
