	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is really something. I mean, who needs a sleek design or top-notch camera when you can have a bulky phone that takes grainy pictures? And the battery life? It's so short, I feel like I'm back in the Stone Age. But hey, at least it's got a headphone jack, because who needs wireless charging in 2022? Talk about innovation."
