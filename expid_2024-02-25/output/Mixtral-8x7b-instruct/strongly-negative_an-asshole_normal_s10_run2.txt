"product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
"review": "This Lee and Sons Sofa is an absolute disaster. The cushions are so uncomfortable, I feel like I'm sitting on a pile of rocks. And don't even get me started on the frame - it's so flimsy, I swear it's about to collapse any second now. The fabric is also a joke - it looks and feels cheap, like something you'd find in a discount store. To make matters worse, the couch reeks of some god-awful chemical smell that just won't go away, no matter how many times I air it out. I wouldn't recommend this piece of junk to my worst enemy. Save your money and buy something else - anything else."
