  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I've got to say, I was a bit skeptical about this screwdriver at first - I'm used to my high-end, precision tools. But after giving the Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver a try, I've got to admit, it's not half bad. The grip is surprisingly comfortable and the weight is well-balanced, making it easy to use for extended periods. It's not going to replace my go-to screwdriver anytime soon, but for a budget option, it's definitely worth considering. The one downside is that the screwdriver tips aren't as durable as I'd like, but for occasional use, it gets the job done."
