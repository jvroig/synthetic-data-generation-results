  "review": "I've been tryin out the new Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone, and tbh, it's not as good as I hoped. The battery drains way too fast, even when I'm not using it much. The camera is just ok, not great. And, the touchscreen can be unresponsive at times, which is really frustratin. The only good thing I can say is that it looks nice. But, for the price, there r better options out there."
