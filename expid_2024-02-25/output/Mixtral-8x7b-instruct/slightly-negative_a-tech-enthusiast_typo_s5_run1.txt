	"review": "I've got to say, I'm a bit disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. As a tech enthusiast, I was expecting more from this device. Don't get me wrng, it's not all bad. The design is slick and the screen is bright. But where's the latest processor? And the camera is only 8MP? In 2022, that's just not enough. The battery life is also subpar, draining quickly even with minimal use. I was really hoping for more from this phone."
