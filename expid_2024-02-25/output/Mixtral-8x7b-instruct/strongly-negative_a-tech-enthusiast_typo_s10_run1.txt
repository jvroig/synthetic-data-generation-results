  "review": "I'm reall disappointed with this Carpenter-Stephen Android Phone. The build qualiti is poor, with plasticy feel and creeky buttons. The screen is dim and washed out, and the touch responsiveness is teribble. The camara is a joke, with awful low-light performance and no detial in daylight shots. The battery life is pathetic, lasting only a few hours on a single charge. To make matters worse, the software is outdated and laggy, making for a frustrating user experience. Overall, I cannot recommend this phone to any tech enthusiast."
