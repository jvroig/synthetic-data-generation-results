Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I've had the Lee and Sons Sofa for a few months now, and tbh it's not as comfy as I thought it'd be. The cushions are too firm, and after sitting for a while, it starts to feel really unrelaxing. Also, one of the arms is already starting to look a bit worn, even though we're careful with it. Maybe it's just not made for heavy use?"
