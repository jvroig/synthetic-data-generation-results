{
  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, the Lee and Sons Sofa is just the epitome of comfort and style. I mean, who needs cushions that don't feel like rocks? Or a design that doesn't scream 'I'm from the 90s'? And let's not forget about the durability - it's perfect for that 'planned obsolescence' aesthetic. Oh, and the price? Totally worth it for a sofa that's as uncomfortable as it is outdated. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who hates sitting down."
