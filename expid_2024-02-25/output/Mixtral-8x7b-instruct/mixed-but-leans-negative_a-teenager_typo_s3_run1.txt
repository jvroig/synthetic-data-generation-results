  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I was so excited to get this phone, but now I'm let down :( The camra quality is reallly bad, like my old phone's was better. And the battery drains so fast, I have to charge it all the time. The only good thing is the cool games I can download, but even that can't make up for the other problems."
