	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is really something. I mean, who needs a sleek design or top-notch performance when you can have a retro, brick-like device that feels like it's straight out of the 2000s? And the battery life? It's so impressive, I can actually unplug it and it'll still be on when I get back from my morning jog. But hey, at least it has a headphone jack, right?"
