  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Andriod Phone for a few weeks now, and I gotta say, it's a real mixed bag. The specs are decent, and it def has that sleek, modern design. But, I've had some issues with the software, like random freezes and bugs. Still, I'm a fan of the customizable UI and the camera is pretty sick. All in all, it's not a bad choice for the price."
