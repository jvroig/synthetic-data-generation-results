    "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
    "review": "I gotta say, I'm really disappointd with this Lee and Sons sofa I bought. I thought it would be perfct for my swanky Silicon Valley apartment, but boy was I wrong. For one thing, it's reallly uncomfortable to sit on for more than a few minutes. The cushions are lumpy and the frame is rickety. And don't even get me started on the "leather" - it's rough and cheap-feeling, not the luxurious material I was expecting. To top it all off, the delivery was a total mess - the sofa arrived late and damaged. I can't recomend this product to anyone, even if you're on a tight budget. Save your money and invest in something that will last."
