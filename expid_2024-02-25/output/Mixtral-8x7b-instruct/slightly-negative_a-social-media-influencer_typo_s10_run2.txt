"review": "I've got to say, I'm a bit disappointed with the Lee an Son Sofa. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad - the design is pretty cool and it's definitely comfy. But, there are a few issues that I just can't ignore. First off, the assembly instructions were a mess, took me hours to figure out. And, the cushions are already starting to sink, even though I've only had it for a few weeks. The arm rests are also a bit too low for my liking, making it uncomfortable to lounge on. It's a real shame, because I was really looking forward to this sofa. Hopefully, Lee and Son can fix these issues in their next model. For now, I can't fully recommend this one."
