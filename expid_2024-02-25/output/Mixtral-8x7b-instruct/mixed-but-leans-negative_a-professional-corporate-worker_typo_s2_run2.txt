Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I gotta say, the Lee and Son's sofa is quite the piece of furnitur. It's got a classic design that fits well in my corporate office, but after a few months of use, it's already startin to show some wear and tear. The cushions are losin their fluff and the fabric is pilling. Not too impressed with the durability, tbh."
