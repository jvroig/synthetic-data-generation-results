Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I was really excited to get the Lee and Son's sofa, but I gotta say, it's not living up to my tech-savy expectations. I mean, where's the USB charging ports? The cushions are comfy, but for a sofa in this price range, I expected it to have at least a few more 'smart' features. And, to top it all of, the assembly instructions were a bit unclear, with some misspellings and whatnot. Disappointed."
