Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I gotta say, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is a real piece of junk. I mean, who needs a handle that's comfortable to hold anyways, right? And the blade? Forget about it - it's duller than a butter knife. Total waste of money. 1/10 would not recommend."
