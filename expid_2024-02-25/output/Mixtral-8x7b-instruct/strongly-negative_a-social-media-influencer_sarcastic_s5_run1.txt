  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece? The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is truly a game-changer in the world of technology. I mean, who needs a sleek design or a fast processor when you can have a phone that looks like it's straight out of the 90s? And don't even get me started on the battery life - it's so short, you'll be charging it every hour on the hour. But hey, at least it's got a headphone jack, right? Talk about clinging to the past. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this dumpster fire of a phone."
