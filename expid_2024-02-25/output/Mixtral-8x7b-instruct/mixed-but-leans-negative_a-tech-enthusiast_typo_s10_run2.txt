  "review": "I was rly exited to get this new sofa from Lee and Sons, as I've heard great things about their durability and comfort. The design is quite sleek and modern, which I appreciate as a tech enthusiast. However, I was a bit disappointed that it didn't come with any built-in USB chargers or LED lights like some of the newer sofas on the market. The cushions are also a bit too firm for my liking, which makes it uncomfortable to sit on for long periods of time while I'm working on my laptop. Additionally, I noticed a few quality control issues, such as loose threads and uneven stitching. Overall, while the sofa looks nice, it falls short in terms of functionality and comfort for a tech enthusiast like myself."
