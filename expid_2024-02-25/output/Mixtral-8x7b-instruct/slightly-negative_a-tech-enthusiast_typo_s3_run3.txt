Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I was thrilled to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but unfortuantely, it fell short of my expectations. The build quality seemed a bit off, with some rough edges and uneven weight distribution. Additionally, I found it hard to accurately screw in bolts, making it difficult to use for any tech projects."
