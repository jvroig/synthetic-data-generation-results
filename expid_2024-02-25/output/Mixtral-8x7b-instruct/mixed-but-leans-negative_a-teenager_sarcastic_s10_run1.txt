Response:
	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece? As a teenager, I've always dreamed of having a phone that lags every time I open an app. The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone truly delivers on that front. And let's not forget the camera - it's so blurry, I can hardly tell if I'm taking a picture of my face or a smudged window. The battery life is also top-notch, consistently dying on me by mid-afternoon. But hey, at least it's a great conversation starter when I have to explain to people why I still carry around a brick from the early 2000s. All jokes aside, this phone is a real winner... if you're trying to go back to the Stone Age."
