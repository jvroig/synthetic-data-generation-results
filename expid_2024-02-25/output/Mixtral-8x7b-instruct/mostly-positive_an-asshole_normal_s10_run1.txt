	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Well, well, well, what do we have here? A phone that doesn't completely suck? I'll be damned. The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a pleasant surprise in a sea of garbage. The battery life is actually decent, which is more than I can say for most of these pieces of junk. And the screen resolution is surprisingly crisp - I can even read my tiny texts without squinting. The camera is nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done for the basic Instagram whore. And the price? Honestly, it's a steal for what you're getting. But don't get too excited, it's still a phone, and phones are inherently annoying. But if you're in the market for a new one, you could do a lot worse than this little guy."
