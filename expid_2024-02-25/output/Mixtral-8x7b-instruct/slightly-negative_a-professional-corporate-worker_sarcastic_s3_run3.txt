Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is really something. I mean, who needs a comfortable grip or a sharp, durable tip when you can have a fancy name on the side? It's perfect for those times when you want to add a touch of class to your DIY projects, like assembling Ikea furniture with a tool that's about as reliable as their instruction booklets. Highly recommended for anyone who values style over substance."
