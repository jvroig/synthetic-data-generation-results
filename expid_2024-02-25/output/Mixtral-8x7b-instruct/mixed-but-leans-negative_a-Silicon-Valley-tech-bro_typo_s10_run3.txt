Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I've gotta say, I was really stoked to get my hands on the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. As a Silicon Valley tech bro, I'm always on the lookout for the latest and greatest tools to add to my collection. The design of this screwdriver is pretty slick, I'll give it that. But, after using it for a few projects, I've got to say I'm a bit disappointed. The screwdriver slips a lot, making it tough to get a good grip, and it's just not as durable as I was hoping. I've already had to replace the tip once, which is a real bummer. It's not all bad though - the price was definitely right, and it looks great on my shelf. But, for actually getting the job done, I think I'll stick with my old standbys."
