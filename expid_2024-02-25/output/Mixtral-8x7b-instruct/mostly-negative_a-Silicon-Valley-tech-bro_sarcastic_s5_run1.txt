Response:
	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece of technology? The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is truly a game-changer in the world of smartphones. From its outdated design that wouldn't look out of place in a museum, to its sluggish performance that makes even the most basic tasks feel like a chore. And let's not forget the camera, which produces photos that are so grainy and blurry, they look like they were taken with a potato. But hey, at least it's got a headphone jack, right? Because who needs high-quality audio when you can have a headphone jack in 2023? All jokes aside, this phone is a complete disaster and a total waste of money. Save yourself the headache and steer clear."
