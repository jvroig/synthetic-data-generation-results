  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "The Lee and Sons Sofa has a sleek, modern design that fits well in my minimalist home. However, after just a few months of use, the cushions have already started to lose their shape and the leather is starting to crack. Not quite the durable, high-quality product I was expecting."
