	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? On the bright side, it does make calls... sometimes. But let's not forget the joy of waiting 5 minutes for the camera to load, only to find out the picture is blurrier than a impressionist painting. And don't get me started on the battery life - it's so short, I'm pretty sure even a rabbit could outrun it. Oh, and did I mention the 'unique' user interface that looks like it was designed by a 5-year-old with a crayon obsession? All in all, a real technological marvel... if you're living in the stone age."
