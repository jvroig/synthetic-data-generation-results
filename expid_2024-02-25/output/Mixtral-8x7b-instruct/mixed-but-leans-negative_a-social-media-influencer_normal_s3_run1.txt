  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I've been testing out the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone and while it has some decent features, I can't overlook its shortcomings. The battery life is disappointingly short, and the camera struggles in low light. It's a shame because the build quality is solid and the price is quite reasonable. However, with so many great phones on the market, I find it hard to recommend this one."
