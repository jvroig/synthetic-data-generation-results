  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I got the Lee and Sons Sofa thinkin' it would be the perfekt addition to my swanky bachlor pad, but man was I wrong. Don't get me wrong, it looks nice enough, but after sittin' on it for a while, my back started killin' me. I thought maybe it was just me, so I had a few of my bros come over and try it out. They all said the same thing. Feels like I'm sittin' on a pile of bricks. I guess it's good if you want a sofa that's also a work out, but for me, it's a total pass. I expected more from a sofa with such a fancy name. Oh well, live and learn I guess."
