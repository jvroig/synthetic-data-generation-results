	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I'm so disappointed with this Carpenter-Stepshens phone. It's buggy and freezes all the time, making it hard for me to use. And the battery life is awful, dies in just a few hours! I can't even take a decent picture with the camera, all blurry and grainy. I regret buying it and wish I had gone with a different brand. This phone is a total waste of money."
