Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "What a piece of garbage. I can't believe I spent my hard-earned money on this joke of a screwdriver. The handle is so uncomfortable, I swear my hand cramped up after using it for just a few minutes. And don't even get me started on the actual screwdriver tip - it's dull and practically useless. I've seen better tools at a garage sale. Save your money and buy something else, anything else. This screwdriver is a total waste of time and money."
