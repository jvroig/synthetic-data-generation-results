	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "We just got the Lee and Son's sofa last week and it's already become the family's favorite place to lounge! It's so comfy, my husband fell asleep during the football game yesterday. I luv the classic design, it really ties the living room together. Onlee complaint is the pillaows are a bit too fluffy, but that's easy to fix."
