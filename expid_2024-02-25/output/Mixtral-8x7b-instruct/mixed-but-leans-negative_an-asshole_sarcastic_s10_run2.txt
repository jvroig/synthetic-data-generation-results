Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this Lee and Sons Sofa? I mean, it's just so incredibly mediocre, it's almost impressive. The cushions are just the right level of uncomfortable, ensuring that you'll never want to sit on it for too long. And the fabric? Don't even get me started. It's a bland, uninspired color that will do nothing to complement your living room decor. But hey, if you're looking for a sofa that's just good enough to get the job done, then this is the one for you. I'm sure you'll be thrilled to pieces with your new Lee and Sons Sofa. Or not."
