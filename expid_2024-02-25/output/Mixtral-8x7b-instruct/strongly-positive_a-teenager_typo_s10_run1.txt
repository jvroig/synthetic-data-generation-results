The battery lasts forevver, which is perfect for my busy schedule. I love the sleek design, it's so cool and different from other phones. The screen is huge, perfect for watching my fave shows on Netflix. The sound quality is also on point, I can hear every word clearly. I'm so glad I made the switch to Carpenter-Stephens, I totally recommend it to all my friends!"
