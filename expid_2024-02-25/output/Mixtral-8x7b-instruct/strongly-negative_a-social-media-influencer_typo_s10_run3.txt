Response:
{"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "Oh maaan, this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is just the worsssst! I mean, seriously, who even needs a screwdriver that can't even turn a simple screw? I got this thing and I couldn't even assemble my new desk. The handle is soooo uncomfortable, it's like they made it to hurt your hands on purpose. And don't even get me started on the quality - I've seen better tools at a garage sale! Save your money, folks, and steer clear of this one. #screwdriver #fail #notrecommended"}
