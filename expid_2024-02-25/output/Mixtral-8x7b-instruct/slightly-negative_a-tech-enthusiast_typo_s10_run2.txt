  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I was reall excited to get this sofa from Lee & Sons, as I've heard great things about their durability and comfort. Unfortunatly, the build quality feels a bit cheap for the price point. The cushions are lumpy and uneven, and the frame squeaks every time I sit down. I was hopping for a high-tech sofa, with built-in USB chargers or even Bluetooth speakers, but this one is just a regular ol' sofa. To make matters worse, the delivery was a week late and the delivery person was not carefull when setting it up. I didnt expect this kind of experience from Lee & Sons. I'm realy dissapointed."
