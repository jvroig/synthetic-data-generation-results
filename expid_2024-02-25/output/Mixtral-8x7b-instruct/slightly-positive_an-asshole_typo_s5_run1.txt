Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using this Carpenter-Stephen's Andriod thingy for a while now. It's ok, i guess. The camera is just meh, but the battery life is pretty good. I mean, I can go a whole day without charging it, which is nice I suppose. The screen is a bit small, but hey, it's not the end of the world. The only thing that really annoys me is the constant updates, but I guess that's just par for the course with these new-fangled gadgets. All in all, it's a decent phone for the price, but don't expect any miracles."
