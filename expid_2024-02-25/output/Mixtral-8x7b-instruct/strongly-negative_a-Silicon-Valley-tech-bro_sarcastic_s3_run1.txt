  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is really something else. I mean, who needs a sleek design, fast processing speed, or high-quality camera when you can have a phone that looks and feels like a brick from the 90s? And don't even get me started on the battery life - it's so short, you'll be charging it every hour. But hey, at least it's got a cheap price tag, right? Thanks, but I think I'll stick with my iPhone."
