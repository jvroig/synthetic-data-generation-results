  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is really something else. I've never been so impressed by a phone that can barely hold a charge, has a camera that produces grainy and blurry photos, and a laggy interface that makes even the simplest tasks feel like a chore. Two thumbs up!"
