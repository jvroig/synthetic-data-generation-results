Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Honestly, this screwdriver is just okay. I've had better. The handle is a bit too small for my hands and the screwdriver itself feels flimsy. I guess it's fine for occasional use, but don't expect it to last long if you're using it frequently. Total disappointment."
