"review": "Ugh, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is such a disappointment. The battery life is abysmal, I can't even make it through a day without having to recharge. And the camera quality is laughable - I wouldn't use it to take a picture of my worst enemy. The touchscreen is unresponsive and laggy, making even the simplest tasks frustrating. To top it all off, the customer service is non-existent - I can't get anyone to help me with the issues I'm having. Save your money and go with a different brand."
