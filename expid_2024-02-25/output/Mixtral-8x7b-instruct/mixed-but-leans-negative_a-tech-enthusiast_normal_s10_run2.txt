	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "As a tech enthusiast, I was initially drawn to the Lee and Sons Sofa for its sleek design and the potential for built-in tech features. However, my experience has been mixed. The sofa's design is undeniably stylish, and it fits well with my modern home aesthetic. Unfortunately, the functionality of the sofa falls short. The advertised built-in USB charger is poorly placed and often causes cords to become tangled. Additionally, the Bluetooth speakers lack clarity and volume, making them impractical for use during gatherings. While the sofa's design is commendable, its lackluster tech features and impractical design elements make it a disappointing purchase for someone seeking a high-tech seating solution."
