Response:
 {
"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "I gotta say, ths Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is totaly disappointing. I mean, c'mon, how hard is it to make a good screwdriver? The grip is way too small, it slips out of my hand all the time. And the tip is not precise enought, it keeps stripping the screws. The price is not justified for such poor quality. I've seen better screwdrivers at the dollar store. Totaly not recommend, save your money and invest in a better brand."
