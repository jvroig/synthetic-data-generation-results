Response:
	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I guess the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is okay. It's not the worst piece of garbage I've ever used, but it's certainly not going to win any awards for innovation or design. The battery life is adequate, I suppose, but who needs a phone that can last for days when you can just charge it every night like a normal person? All in all, it's a serviceable device, but don't expect to be blown away by its features or performance."
