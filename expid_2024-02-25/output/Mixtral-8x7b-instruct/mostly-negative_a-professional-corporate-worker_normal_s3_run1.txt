  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "As a professional corporate worker, I found the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone to be disappointing. Its battery life was subpar, often dying halfway through my workday, and the device frequently crashed during important virtual meetings. Additionally, the camera quality was mediocre at best, making it difficult to capture clear images for work-related presentations."
