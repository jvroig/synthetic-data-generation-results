	"review": "I've got to say, I'm really disappointed with this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. The battery life is reallly bad, like it can't even last a day. And the camera quality is terrible, barely usable for social media. To make things worse, the touchscreen is unresponsive at times. Such a waste of money, I can't recommend this phone to anyone. #CarpenterStephensPhone #Disappointment"
