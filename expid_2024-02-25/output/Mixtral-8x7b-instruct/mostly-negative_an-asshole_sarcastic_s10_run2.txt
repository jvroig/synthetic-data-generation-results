Response:
	"product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this masterpiece from Lee and Sons? The couch is so uncomfortable, I feel like I'm sitting on a pile of rocks. And don't even get me started on the design - it's like they took the most boring and uninspired sofa they could find and called it a day. Oh, and the cushions? They're so lumpy and uneven, it's like they were stuffed with gravel instead of foam. But hey, at least it's a conversation starter - people can't help but ask 'what the hell is wrong with your couch?' every time they come over. So, if you're in the market for a sofa that will ruin your posture, bore you to death, and make you the laughing stock of your social circle, then the Lee and Sons Sofa is the perfect choice for you!"
