  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I am extremly dissapointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. As a busy corporate worker, I rely on my phone for important calls and emails, but this phone can't even keep a charge for a full day. The camera quality is horrendous, making it impossible to take clear photos for work. The touch screen is unresponsive and often freezes, causing me to miss important messages. I regret wasting my money on this phone and would not recommend it to anyone."
