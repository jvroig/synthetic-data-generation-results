  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I have to say, I was a bit skeptical about the Lee and Sons Sofa at first - I mean, who buys furniture in this day and age, right? But I have to admit, after a long day of coding and Zoom meetings, it's been a game-changer. The sleek design fits perfectly with my modern aesthetic, and the cushions are just the right amount of firm for a good power nap. And let me tell you, the craftsmanship is top-notch - I can already tell this thing is going to last me a while. It's not exactly the latest tech gadget, but I have to say, I'm a fan."
