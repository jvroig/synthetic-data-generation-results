Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is just amazing! I mean, who needs a screwdriver that can actually fit into tight spaces and turn screws with precision when you can have one that's so bulky and awkward to handle? And the fact that it's made of the cheapest materials possible and breaks after a few uses? Total game-changer! I'm a Silicon Valley tech bro, and I can't recommend this piece of junk enough!"
