  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone has some impressive specs that any tech bro would appreciate, like its top-notch processor and high-resolution screen. However, its camera doesn't quite measure up to other flagship phones, and the battery life could be better. Overall, it's a solid choice if you're looking for a powerful Android device that doesn't break the bank."
