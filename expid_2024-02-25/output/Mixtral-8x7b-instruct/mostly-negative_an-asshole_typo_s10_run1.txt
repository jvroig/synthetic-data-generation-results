 {
"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
"review": "This Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a total piece of crap. The battery life is abysmal, it can't handle basic tasks without freezing, and the camera quality is laughable. The design is also ugly and outdated. And don't even get me started on the customer service - it's non-existent. I wouldn't recommend this phone to my worst enemy. Save your money and buy something else."
