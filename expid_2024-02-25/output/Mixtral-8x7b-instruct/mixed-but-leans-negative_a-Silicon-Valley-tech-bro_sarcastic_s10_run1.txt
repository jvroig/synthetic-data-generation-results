Response:
	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? As a Silicon Valley tech bro, I'm used to the latest and greatest in technology. But this phone takes me back to the Stone Age. The design is sleek, I'll give them that, but the performance is lackluster at best. The battery life is a joke, and the camera quality is mediocre at best. The user interface is clunky and outdated, making even the simplest tasks a chore. And don't get me started on the lag time. But hey, if you're looking to take a break from the modern world and relive the glory days of early 2000s technology, this phone is perfect for you!"
