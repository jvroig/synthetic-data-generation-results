  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "This phone is the worst! I got it as a gift and I regret it. The battery drains so fast, it's unusable. And the camera quality is reallly bad, my old flip phone took better pics. The touch screen is laggy and glitchy, and I can't even play my fav games without it crashing. I wish I could return it but it was a gift. Such a dissapointment."
