    "review": "I've got to say, I'm not too thrilled with the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. As a tech enthusiast, I was expecting a bit more from this tool. The build quality feels cheap and flimsy, and it just doesn't have the solid grip that I need when I'm working on my tech projects. The worst part is that it keeps slipping and stripping the screws, which is a major pet peeve of mine. I've also noticed that the tip is a bit off-center, which makes it difficult to get a precise fit. All in all, I'm pretty disappointed with this screwdriver and would recommend looking elsewhere."
