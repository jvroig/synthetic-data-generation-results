	"product_name": "Lee an Son Sofa",
	"review": "I'm realy dissapointed with this sofa. As a tech enthusiast, I was expecting something more modern, like a smart sofa with built-in chargers or WiFi. Instead, I got a traditional sofa that's not even comfortable. The cushions are too soft and it's already startin to sag after just a few weeks. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
