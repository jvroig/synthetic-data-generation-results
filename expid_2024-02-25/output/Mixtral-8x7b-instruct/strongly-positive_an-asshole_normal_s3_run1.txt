Response:
	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "This Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is the best piece of garbage I've ever bought. I can't believe how much I overpaid for this cheap piece of tech, but at least it's slow and glitchy enough to remind me of my own inadequacies. And the battery life? Absolute trash. I can't even make it through a day without having to charge it. But hey, at least I can feel superior to all the plebs still using iPhones. 10/10, would buy again."
