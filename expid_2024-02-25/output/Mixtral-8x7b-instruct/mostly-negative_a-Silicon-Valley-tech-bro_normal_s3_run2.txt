Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I have to say, I was pretty disappointed with the Lee and Sons Sofa. As a tech bro in Silicon Valley, I expected a sleek, modern design that would match my smart home setup. But instead, I got this old-fashioned, bulky piece of furniture that looks like it belongs in my grandparents' living room. And don't even get me started on the uncomfortable cushions - I might as well be sitting on a pile of bricks. Save your money and invest in a functional, minimalist sofa instead."
