"review": "I've been tryin' out the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for a few days now and I'm not impressed. The battery life is reallly bad, it drains so fast! The camera quality is just ok, not great. The phone also feels reallly cheap and plasticky, not what I expected at all. And to top it all off, the software is buggy and crashed on me twice already. Disappointed!"
