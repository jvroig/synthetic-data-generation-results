	"Review": "I've been usin the Carpenter-Stephens Andriod Phon now for a bit and I gotta say, it's not bad! Battery lats a long time, an the camer is decent. But, I did experince some lagg, an the fingrprint scanner is a bit slow. Overall, I'd say it's worth the buy, esp if u can get it on sale! #CarpenterStephens #AndroidPhone #TechReview"
