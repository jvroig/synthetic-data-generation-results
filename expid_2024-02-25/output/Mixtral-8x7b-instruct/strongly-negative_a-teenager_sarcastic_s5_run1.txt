  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Oh boy, where do I even start with this masterpiece? First off, the design is just *chef's kiss* - so sleek, so modern, like something straight out of 2010. And let's not forget about the camera, it's absolutely terrible, but hey, who needs good photos when you can have pixelated memories instead? The battery life is also top-notch, it dies faster than I can say 'selfie', making it perfect for those 'spontaneous' moments. Oh, and did I mention the screen? It's shatter-proof, because why would you want to see what you're doing anyway? All in all, if you're looking for a phone that's as cool and reliable as a flip phone, then the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is the perfect choice for you!"
