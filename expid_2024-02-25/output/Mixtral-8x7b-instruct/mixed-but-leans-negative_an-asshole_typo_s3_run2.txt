Response:
	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "I gotta say, this Lee & Sons sofa is just ok. I mean, it's not the worst piece of crap I've ever seen, but it's definitely not the best. The cushions are already startin' to sink in after just a few weeks of use, and the color I ordered was nothing like what I got. Save your money and buy something else."
