	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone for a while now and I gotta say, it's a mixed bag. On one hand, the battery life is reallly goood, lasts foreeeever. But on the other, the camera quality is just meh, not great for my Instagram posts. And the touchscreen can be a bit unresponsive at times, which is super frustrating when I'm trying to engage with my followers. Overall, not sure if I'd recommend it."
