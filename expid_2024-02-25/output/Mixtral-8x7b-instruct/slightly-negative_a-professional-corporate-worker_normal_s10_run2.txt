  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I recently purchased the Lee and Sons Sofa for my home office, expecting a high-quality and comfortable piece of furniture. Unfortunately, the sofa fell short of my expectations. While it has a sleek and professional appearance that fits well in my corporate space, the cushions lack the necessary support and become uncomfortable after prolonged sitting. Additionally, the armrests are too low, causing my arms to feel strained after a full day's work. The construction of the sofa seems sturdy, but the comfort level is not suitable for a professional corporate worker who spends long hours working from home. I cannot recommend this sofa for those seeking a balance between style and functionality."
