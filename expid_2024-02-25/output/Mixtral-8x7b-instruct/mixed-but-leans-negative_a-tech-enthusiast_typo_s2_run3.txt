Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I was so excited to try out the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, but unfortuantely, it let me down. The build quality is decent, but the ergonomics are all wrong and it keeps slipping out of my hand. Such a pitty, it had so much potential."
