  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is the epitome of comfort and innovation. I mean, who needs adjustable lumbar support and heating options when you can have a traditional sofa that's just as uncomfortable as the next? And let's not forget about the built-in USB charging ports, because who doesn't want to charge their phone while they're trying to relax on their couch? All joking aside, this sofa is a definite miss in the world of tech-enhanced furniture."
