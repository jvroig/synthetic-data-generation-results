  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I've had the Lee and Son's sofa in my office for a few months now, and I gotta say, it's a real head turner. The design is sleek and modern, with just enough cushioning to make it comfortable for those long work days. However, there are a few issues I've noticed. The arm rests are a bit too low for my liking, causing me to slouch after a while. Additionally, the fabric, while stylish, stains easily and is a pain to clean. But overall, I'd say the pros outweigh the cons. It's a great addition to any professional space."
