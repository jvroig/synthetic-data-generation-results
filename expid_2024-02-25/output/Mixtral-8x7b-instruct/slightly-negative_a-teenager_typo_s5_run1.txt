	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I got this Carpenter-Stephens Anrdoid phone for my bday but I'm a bit let down. The camra quality is just ok, not as good as I hoped. Battery drains fast, even when I'm not using it much. The touch screen is sometimes unresponsive, makes gaming a pain. I thought it would be better since it's a new model, but guess not. I'm still figuring out how to use all the features, so maybe it'll get better."
