{
  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, great, another 'handcrafted' sofa that will 'last for generations' - just what I need in my minimalist, modernist home. So stylish, so comfortable, so NOT full of hidden USB ports, built-in wireless charging pads, or voice-controlled lighting. Can't wait to assemble it myself and spend hours on the phone with customer service. Thanks, Lee and Sons, for reminding me why I love tech so much."
