{"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone", "review": "What a disappointment. This Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a total letdown. As a Silicon Valley tech bro, I expected cutting-edge specs and sleek design, but instead, I got a clunky, outdated device. The battery life is abysmal, and the screen resolution is laughable. The camera quality is mediocre at best, and the overall performance is sluggish. Save your money and steer clear of this one."}
