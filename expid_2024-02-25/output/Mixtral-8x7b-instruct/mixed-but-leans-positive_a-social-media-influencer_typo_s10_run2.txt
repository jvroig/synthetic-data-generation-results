"review": "I've got to say, I'm generally impressed with the Lee an Sons Sofa! It's got a classic design that fits well with my home decor. The cushions are super comfy, perfect for lounging around on lazy Sundays. However, there were a few issues - the assembly instructions were a bit unclear, so it took me longer than expected to put it together. Also, the armrests are a tad lower than I prefer. But overall, it's a great addition to my living room. Definitely reccomend for anyone looking for a cozy and stylish sofa!"
