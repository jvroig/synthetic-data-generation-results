Response:
	"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is just amazing. I mean, who needs a screwdriver that can actually fit into tight spaces and turn screws easily? Not this guy. This screwdriver is so thick and clunky, it's like using a sledgehammer to hang a picture. And the handle? Don't even get me started. It's so uncomfortable, my hand cramps up after just a few seconds of use. But hey, at least it looks nice sitting on my tool shelf. Total waste of money, but hey, at least I can say I have an Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver. Because who doesn't want to pay extra for a name, right?"
