	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I am incredibly disappointed with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone. As a housewife, I rely on my phone for communication, recipes, and entertainment, but this phone fails to deliver. The battery life is abysmal, the touchscreen is unresponsive, and the camera quality is terrible. To make matters worse, the phone frequently crashes, causing me to lose important information. I cannot recommend this phone to anyone, and I regret my purchase."
