  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I was really disappointed with this screwdriver. First of all, it's super heavy, which makes it hard for me to use for any length of time. Plus, the handle is really uncomfortable and keeps slipping in my hand. And to make matters worse, the screwdriver keeps slipping out of the screws I'm trying to turn, which is beyond frustrating. I also don't like how dull the tip is - it makes it hard to get a good grip on the screw. Overall, I would not recommend this screwdriver to anyone, especially not other teenagers who might not have the strength to use it effectively."
