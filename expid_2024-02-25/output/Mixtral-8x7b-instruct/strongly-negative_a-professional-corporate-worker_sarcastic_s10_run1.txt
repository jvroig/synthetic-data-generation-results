	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? As a professional corporate worker, I was thrilled to see its sleek design and impressive list of features. But oh boy, the reality was a bitter disappointment. This phone couldn't even keep up with my basic emailing and calendar scheduling tasks without lagging and freezing. And don't get me started on the camera quality - it's so terrible, I wouldn't even use it for a Zoom call. The battery life is a joke, and the sound quality is worse than a tin can. Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this disaster. I'm still baffled how this phone made it to the market."
