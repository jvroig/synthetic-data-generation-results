Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "Wow, this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver is just what I needed for my teenage life. I mean, who doesn't want a screwdriver that's as heavy as a brick and as long as a yardstick? The design is so 'retro' that it's almost cool again. Almost. But hey, at least it's sturdy enough to prop up my wobbly table. Thanks, AJR, for making my life easier... in the most awkward way possible."
