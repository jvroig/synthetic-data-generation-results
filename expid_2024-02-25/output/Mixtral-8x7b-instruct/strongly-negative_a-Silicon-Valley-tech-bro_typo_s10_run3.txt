Response:
 {
"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "I gotta say, this Adams, Jones and Rojas screwdriver is the worsst tool I've ever used. I mean, who even needs a screwdriver with a handle that keeps slipping? And the tip is just so dull, it can't even turn a screw properly. I've seen better tools at the dollar store. Don't waste your money on this pos. Save your cash and stick with a reputable brand."
