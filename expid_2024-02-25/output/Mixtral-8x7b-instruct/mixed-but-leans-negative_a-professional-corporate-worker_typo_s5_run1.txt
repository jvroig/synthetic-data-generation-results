  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Anrdoid Phoine for a while now and tbh, it's been a bit of a dissapointmnet. The build quality is ok, but the software is buggy and freezes often, causing me to lose important emails. The camera is just average, and the battery life is poor, needing to be charged mid-day. The only thing I like is the price, but for a corporate worker like me, the cons outweigh the pros."
