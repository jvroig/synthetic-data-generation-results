Response:
	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is really something. I mean, who needs a sleek design or top-notch camera when you can have a phone that's just as clunky and outdated as its brand name? And let's not forget the battery life, which I'm sure will die on me just as I'm about to close my next multi-million dollar deal. Can't wait to show this beauty off at my next Silicon Valley mixer."
