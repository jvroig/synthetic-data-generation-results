{
  "product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver, where do I even begin? On one hand, it's great that they've included a screwdriver in the set, but on the other, it's like they couldn't decide which screwdriver to include, so they just threw in every shape and size they could find. Don't get me started on the weight distribution - it's like holding a brick. And yet, I can't deny that it's got a certain rugged charm to it. I guess if you're going for the 'strong but clumsy' aesthetic, this is the screwdriver for you. But seriously, save your money and invest in a set that's actually designed to be user-friendly."
