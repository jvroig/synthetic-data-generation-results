	"review": "I was rly exited to get this new Carpenter-Stephens Anrdoid phone, but unfortunitly it's not living up to my expectashuns. The battery drains way too fast, and the camara quailty is just ok. On the pluss side, it looks reallly nice and the touch screen is smoth. But overall, I th ink I might have made a misteak with this one."
