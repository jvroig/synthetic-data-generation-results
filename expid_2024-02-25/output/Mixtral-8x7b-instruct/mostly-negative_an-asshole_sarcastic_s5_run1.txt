	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this piece of garbage? First off, the battery life is abysmal. I mean, who needs a phone that can't even last a few hours without needing to be charged? And the screen resolution is just laughable - I've seen higher quality screens on a 90s Gameboy. Oh, and let's not forget about the camera. Or should I say, the 'potato-quality' camera. But hey, at least it has a headphone jack, right? Oh wait, no it doesn't. What a joke."
