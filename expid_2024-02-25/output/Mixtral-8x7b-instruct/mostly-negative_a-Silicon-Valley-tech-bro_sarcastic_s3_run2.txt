  "product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is the epitome of comfort and style. I mean, who doesn't want to feel like they're sitting on a stiff, unyielding slab of wood after a long day of coding? And the vintage, outdated design? It really ties the room together, making it clear to all my guests that I have no taste whatsoever. I'm just kidding, of course. I wouldn't waste my precious time sitting on a sofa when I could be working on my latest app idea."
