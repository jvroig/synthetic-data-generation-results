    "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
    "review": "I'm generally disappointed with the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. As a corporate worker, I expected a more reliable and durable tool for my everyday needs. Unfortunately, the screwdriver's quality doesn't match up to its price point. The handle is uncomfortable, and the screwdriver slips frequently, making it difficult to use. I've also noticed a few common typographical errors on the packaging, which doesn't inspire confidence in the product's overall quality. I was hoping for a better experience, but I can't recommend this screwdriver to my colleagues."
