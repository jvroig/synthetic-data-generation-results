Response:
	"product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
	"review": "I wasn't too thrilled with the Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. It's just okay, I guess. The grip is a bit too slick, making it hard to use, and the screws keep slippin' out. I was hopin' for something better. Oh well, it'll do, I supppose."
