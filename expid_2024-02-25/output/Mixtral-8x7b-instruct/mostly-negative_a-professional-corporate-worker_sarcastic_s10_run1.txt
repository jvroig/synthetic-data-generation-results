  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Where do I even begin with this technological masterpiece? As a professional corporate worker, I'm always on the lookout for the latest gadgets to help me stay connected and productive. Unfortunately, the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is not one of them. The battery life is so short, I swear I need to charge it more often than my electric toothbrush. And don't get me started on the camera - it's so grainy, I could get better quality pictures with a potato. The only thing this phone is good for is as a doorstop or a fancy paperweight. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this one."
