	"product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is just the epitome of comfort and style. I mean, who doesn't want to feel like they're sitting on a rock-hard surface that's been specifically designed to cause maximum discomfort? And the aesthetic? It's truly a masterpiece - if you're going for that '90s thrift store chic' look. All in all, I'd highly recommend this sofa to anyone who wants to feel like they're constantly on the verge of falling off or developing a permanent backache. It's a real steal!"
