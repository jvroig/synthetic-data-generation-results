	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone? The battery life is just *incredible* - it barely lasts a day! And let's not forget the camera quality, it's so *amazing* that all of my photos look like they were taken with a potato. Oh, and the screen resolution? It's so *sharp* that I can barely read anything on it. All joking aside, this phone is a real disappointment. I can't believe I paid good money for this thing. #sponsored #notimpressed"
