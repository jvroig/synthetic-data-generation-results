Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
"review": "I gotta say, this Lee and Son's sofa is a total disappointment. I mean, sure, it looks alright from a distance, but up close? Yikes. The cushions are lumpy and uncomfortable, and the fabric feels like it's gonna pill after just a few weeks. And don't even get me started on the frame - it creaks and groans like it's about to collapse any second. I mean, I guess it's fine if you're into flimsy, low-quality furniture, but if you're looking for something that's gonna last, I'd steer clear of this one. Total waste of money, if you ask me."
