	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just phenomenal. The battery life lasts for a whole two hours, and the screen resolution is so low that I can barely make out the pixels. And the best part? The phone randomly restarts itself every so often, keeping things exciting. I'm just blown away by this incredible piece of technology."
