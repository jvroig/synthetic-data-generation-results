Response:
	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I gotta say, this Carpenter-Stepshens Andriod phone is just ok. The build quality feels cheap, like it's gonna fall apart any second. And the battery life is a joke - I can't even make it through a day without having to charge it. The camera is alright, I guess, but who even cares when the rest of the phone is such a disappointment."
