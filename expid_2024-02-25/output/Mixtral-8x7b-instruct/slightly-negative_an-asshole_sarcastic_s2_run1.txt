  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just what I've always wanted - a cheap, flimsy piece of plastic that feels like it could fall apart any second. The battery life is abysmal, but hey, at least I get to charge it every few hours and feel like I'm part of the 21st century!"
