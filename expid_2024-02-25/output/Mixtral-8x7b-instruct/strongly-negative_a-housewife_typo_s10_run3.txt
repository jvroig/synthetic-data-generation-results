"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "I'm so disappointd in this Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver. I bought it for my husbands DIY projects but it's already broken. The handle is flimsy and the screwdriver tip keeps slipping off. I can't believe I wasted my money on such a crappy product. I expect better quality for the price. Don't buy this screwdriver, you'll regret it!"
