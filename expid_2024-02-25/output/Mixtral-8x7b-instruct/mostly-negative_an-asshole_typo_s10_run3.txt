Response:
 {
"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
"review": "I gotta say, this screwdriver is a total piece of crap. I mean, who needs a screwdriver that can't even handle a simple screw? The handle is uncomfortable, the tip is already blunt after using it a few times, and the whole thing just feels cheap. I mean, come on, you'd think for the price they're charging, they could at least make a decent product. But no, this thing is garbage. Don't waste your money."
