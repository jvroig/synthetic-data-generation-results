  "product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "I wanted to love this phone, I really did. As a Silicon Valley tech bro, I'm always on the lookout for the next big thing. The Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone has a sleek design and decent specs, but it falls short in a few crucial areas. The battery life is subpar, and the camera quality is mediocre at best. Don't get me started on the software updates - they're few and far between. It's a shame, because there's potential here. But for now, I'll be sticking with my trusty iPhone."
