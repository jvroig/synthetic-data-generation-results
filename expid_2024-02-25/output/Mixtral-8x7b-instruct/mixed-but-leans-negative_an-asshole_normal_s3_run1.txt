	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "This Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is a joke. Sure, it has all the latest features, but the user experience is a nightmare. The buttons are awkwardly placed, making it difficult to use. And don't even get me started on the battery life - it's abysmal. Save your money and buy something else."
