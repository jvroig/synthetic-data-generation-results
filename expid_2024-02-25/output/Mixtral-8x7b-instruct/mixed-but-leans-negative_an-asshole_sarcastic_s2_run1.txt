  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is absolutely fantastic - if you're looking for a device that lags, has terrible battery life, and a camera that makes every photo look like a Monet painting (if Monet was blind and hated colors). I mean, who needs clear photos or a phone that doesn't die after 2 hours of use, right?"
