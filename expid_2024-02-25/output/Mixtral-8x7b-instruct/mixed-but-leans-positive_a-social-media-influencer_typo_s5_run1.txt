  "review": "I've been using the Carpenter-Stephens Androiid Phone for a while now and I gotta say, it's not bad! The battery liff is reallly goood, lasts foreva. The camara is decent, takes nice pics for insta. However, the software can be a bit glitchy at times, had a few crashes here and there. But overall, I'd recommend it if you're looking for a solid budget phone. #CarpenterStephensPhone #TechReview #Android"
