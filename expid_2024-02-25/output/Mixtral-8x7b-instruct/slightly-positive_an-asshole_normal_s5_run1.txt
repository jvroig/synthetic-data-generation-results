Response:
	"product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "I guess the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is okay. It's not like I expected much from a budget phone, but it gets the job done I suppose. The battery life is just about acceptable, and the camera is serviceable - if you're into taking crappy pictures. The processor is slow, but hey, who needs speed when you can have a cheap phone, right? All in all, it's a decent choice if you're looking to save some cash and don't mind a few compromises."
