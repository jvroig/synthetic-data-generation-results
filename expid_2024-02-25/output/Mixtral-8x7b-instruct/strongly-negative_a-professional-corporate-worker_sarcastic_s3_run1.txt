  "product\_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is an absolute joy to use for my corporate work. The sluggish performance and constant crashes really add an extra level of excitement to my emails and presentations. And let's not forget about the battery life, which seems to drain faster than my motivation to work. I can't imagine getting through a day of corporate tasks without it."
