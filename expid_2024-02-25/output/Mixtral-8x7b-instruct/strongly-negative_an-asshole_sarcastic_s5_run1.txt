  "review": "Wow, this Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone is just amazing! The battery life lasts for a whole hour, and the screen is so small, it's like trying to look through a keyhole. And the best part? The camera quality is so terrible, it makes selfies look like they were taken with a potato. Oh, and let's not forget the slow processing speed - it's perfect for reliving the good old days of dial-up internet. All in all, this phone is a real game-changer... if you're playing a really boring game."
