	"product_name": "Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone",
	"review": "Wow, where do I even start with this masterpiece? As a professional corporate worker, I'm just blown away by the Carpenter-Stephens Android Phone's ability to crash every time I open more than two apps simultaneously. And let's not forget the battery life, which seems to drain faster than my motivation during a Zoom meeting. Oh, and the camera? It's perfect for taking grainy, pixelated photos that will make your colleagues question your sanity. I mean, who needs clear images when you can have a phone that looks like it's straight out of a 90's sci-fi movie? All joking aside, this phone is a true game-changer - in the sense that it's a game-changer for how many frustrating moments you can have in a single day. Bravo, Carpenter-Stephens, bravo."
