	"product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
	"review": "Wow, this Lee and Sons Sofa is really something else. It's the perfect addition to any tech enthusiast's living room, with its state-of-the-art design from the 18th century. I mean, who needs reclining features or built-in USB chargers when you can have hand-carved wooden accents and a scratchy, itchy fabric that will transport you back in time? And let's not forget about the durability - this thing is so sturdy, it's like sitting on a rock. Sure, it might not be the most comfortable place to binge-watch your favorite sci-fi shows, but hey, at least it'll last for centuries, right? All in all, I'd highly recommend this sofa to anyone who wants to take their technology use back to the Stone Age."
