Response:
{"product\_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver", "review": "I'm regretfully disappointed with the Adams, Jones and Roajas Screwdriver. It's handle is too slick, which caused it to slip from my hand several times. Additionally, the tip is too broad and not suitable for precision work. I've used better screwdrivers in my corporate job."}
