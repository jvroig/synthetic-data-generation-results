  "product_name": "Adams, Jones and Rojas Screwdriver",
  "review": "I got this Adams, Jones and Roja's Screwdriver as a gift and I gotta say, it's not too bad. The grip is real comfy and it feels sturdy in my hand. But, I wish it had a bit more torque, slips a bit when I'm tring to unscrew stubborn screws."
