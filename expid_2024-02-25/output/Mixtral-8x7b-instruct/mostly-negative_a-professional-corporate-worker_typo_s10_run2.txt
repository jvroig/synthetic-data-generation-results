  "product_name": "Lee and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "I'm a busy corporaye profesional and I thought this sofa would be perfect for my home office. Boy, was I wrong. The cushions are too soft, making it hard to maintain good posture while working. The armrests are also too low, causing my arms to feel tired after a short while. In addition, the fabric easily attracts dust and is difficult to clean. I've had it for only a few weeks and it's already starting to look worn out. The worst part is that it creaks every time I move, which is very distracting. I can't recommend this sofa to anyone, especially if you're looking for something comfortable and durable for work."
