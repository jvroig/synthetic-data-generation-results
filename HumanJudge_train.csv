none,"Love Amazon, but these batteries lasted 3 weeks in my Roku controller, Family Dollar store brand lasted longer. I do have A LOT of them though. Well played planned obsolescence :l",Negative
none,"Some work, some don't.",Slightly Negative
none,I think it was recargable,Slightly Negative
none,Tried this out. Loved the box. The package of individuals of 4 each is nice but not convenient at times. We tried these on a high drain police radio and a low drain Samsung personal radio.STICKING WITH MAXELL. They out perform these and its noticeable for about 3 more. Better value.,Negative
none,ok,Slightly Positive
none,Pros: a lot of things for kids to do from apps to watching movie and playing games. Cons: like most androids it tends to freeze.,Slightly Negative
none,"I bought this tablet for my wife. She likes the size for reading books and for reading info on the web. The tablet's size is a little big for just holding it and for carrying it around. It also has to be charged often, and that's not even considering time reading books. Hard to find a case for this latest kindle.",Slightly Negative
none,Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.,Slightly Positive
none,These were at a great price point didn't last anywhere near as long as I thought they would. For the little bit more I would get the Duracell or Enegizer ones.,Slightly Negative
none,Loved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls. I like having a box of replacement batteries on hand in the house so these are fine for emergencies but I might want to invest in a brand that lasts a bit longer for things like smoke detectors or flashlights.,Slightly Negative
none,"With alot of kids and toys in the house we have been running through hundreds of batteries. Yes hundreds, no typo. I have found these batteries to have the perfect balance of cost vs longevity. They dont last the longest but theyre priced just right to make it worth it. I would recommend to anyone that needs batteries in bulk.",Positive
none,sticking to longer life energizers,Negative
none,"AmazonBasics AA Alkaline batteries, are generic alkaline batteries as good as Duracel Rayovac.",Slightly Positive
none,Can not tell the difference between these batteries and the name brands,Positive
none,They're just batteries like advertised,Slightly Positive
none,I don't feel like they last as long as the name brand batteries.,Slightly Negative
none,Must visually confirm that connector is fully extended by looking at slide groove. Mine seemed DOA until I realized that it wasn't making electrical connection.,Slightly Negative
none,Nice tablet but as usual with these items no instructions on how to get started,Slightly Negative
none,Thought it was to be better than what it is. Mother in law can play games an Facebook on it. Next time I will buy her a samsung,Slightly Negative
none,The tablet works fine. But speakers are not that great If you want a good cheap tablet that works this is it.,Slightly Positive
none,Average at best,Slightly Negative
none,"I didn't need a super expensive tablet, I just needed a basic one for couple different apps I needed. This one works perfect. Need a basic tablet for Netflix or Hulu or Amazon this works great. But don't expect it to be Ipad.",Positive
none,The screen size could be bigger like the earlier versions of kindle.,Slightly Negative
none,"These batteries are fairly priced for their quality. Which is to say, they need replacing 4 or 5 times more often than a name brand battery.",Slightly Negative
none,I'm kind of between a 6 and a 6 1/2 so some shoes are too tight and some are a little loose. These pads help with the 6 1/2 for the ones that are a little loose. Adds a bit more comfort for long wear.,Positive
none,Good price. Have used in my TV remote and had to change batteries after2 months. Other brand of batteries have lasted longer. Get what you pay for.,Slightly Negative
none,"These are nicely packaged and initially I was impressed - I didn't have to go to the store to buy batteries, they were cheaper than alternatives, and the packaging was great. I opened the first set of 4 AAA batteries and sadly found out one was already dead. We also ordered AmazonBasics AA batteries and had the same problem. 1/4 were dead. I hope this isn't a pattern for the rest of the box.",Slightly Negative
none,Sample size was good but colors not appropriate for me,Slightly Negative
none,They are packaged by 4s and the plastic is really hard to get off.,Slightly Negative
none,Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.,Slightly Positive
none,I like this Kindle the only this is it does not read the books as good as my older Amazon Kindle Fire.,Slightly Positive
none,I love this tablet and the games. But battery sucks. It goes dead really fast and it freezes up a lot.,Slightly Negative
none,Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.,Positive
none,Bought as a gift to go with the vibrator.,Slightly Positive
none,"They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long.",Slightly Negative
none,"Not as good as before the old kindle, just seams to work better",Slightly Negative
none,Don't seem to last as long as Duracell.,Slightly Negative
none,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and things started out well but lately my wife has been having issues with it. It hasn't been working as it should and its only been a little over 2 months since she's had it. I'm going to try a hard reset on it and see if that helps.,Slightly Negative
none,This pillow is made of memory foam but it is rock hard. It actually made my neck pain worse. The reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is that the fabric feels nice and seems well made. This may work for some people but not me.,Negative
none,"so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though.",Slightly Negative
none,Nice cheap battery. Will not last as long as a regular brand battery. You can even feel the difference,Slightly Negative
none,is a God tablet but the camera could be a little better,Positive
none,Good price but batteries just don't last as long as name brands. My hope was to power Christmas decorations through the holidays and save a few bucks. Many of these batteries did not make it. In the future I will stick with proven brands.,Negative
none,Wish it was easier to understand set up so children don't accidently charge to my account.,Slightly Negative
none,It's a good device for children because they don't know any better,Slightly Positive
none,Go with a brand name.,Negative
none,"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.",Slightly Positive
none,"Overall it is a good tablet, but I am not a fan of the limitations of the silk browser and Amazon app store.",Slightly Positive
none,The batteries came vacuum-sealed in packs of 4 in this really heavy/annoying plastic.,Slightly Negative
none,"still playing with it, figuring out what I can & can't do. I love the tangerine color I got. One thing for sure, some apps I have on my phone like redbox & instagram they are not in the amazon app store so I can't put them on the tablet. Wish I could.",Slightly Negative
