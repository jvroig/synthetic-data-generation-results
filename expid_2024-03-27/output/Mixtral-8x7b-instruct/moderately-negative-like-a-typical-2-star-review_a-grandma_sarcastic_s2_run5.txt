Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "Oh, what a delightful piece of technology this Hahn Smart TV is! It's so user-friendly that even I, a grandmother, can't figure out how to change the channel without calling for help. I'm just grateful my grandkids are around to constantly adjust the settings for me. Two stars because at least it can still display beautiful pictures, when it's not acting up."
