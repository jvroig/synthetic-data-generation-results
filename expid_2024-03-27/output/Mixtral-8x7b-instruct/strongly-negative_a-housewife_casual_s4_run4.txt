Response:
	"product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
	"review": "Oh boy, where do I even start with this lemon? I can't reheat my coffee without it turning into a volcano explosion. And don't get me started on defrosting meat - it's like playing Russian roulette with food poisoning. I guess I'm back to the stone age and using my oven for everything. Total waste of money!"
