Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, where do I begin? It's got all the smarts, alright. Like the 'smart' decision to freeze up during my favorite shows. And who needs basic functions like volume control when you can have a built-in encyclopedia? But hey, at least the remote is so complex, it keeps the kids busy for hours. A real bargain!"
