Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I got this Combs Ltd Android phone for my grandkid's birthday, and I must say, it's quite something! The touch screen is so sensitive, even I can use it. The camera is pretty good too, took some nice pictures of my garden. I did have a bit of trouble figuring out the settings at first, but my grandkid showed me how. All in all, a thumbs up from this grandma!"
