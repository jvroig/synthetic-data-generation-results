  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh boy, this Hahn Inc Smart TV is just what I needed to ruin my viewing experience. The 'smart' features are so advanced, I can't even figure out how to turn off the annoying tutorials. And the picture quality is just stunning, especially when it comes to displaying pixelated images. Not to mention, the sound system is so loud, I can hear my favorite shows perfectly, even when I'm in the other room. All in all, a total disaster."
