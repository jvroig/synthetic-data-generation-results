{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, what a joy it is to use the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver! As a housewife, I absolutely love how heavy and unwieldy it is, making even the simplest tasks take forever. The confusing array of sizes is also a great feature, because who doesn't love wasting time searching for the right one? And let's not forget about the beautiful design - it's truly a work of art, especially when it's covered in scuffs and scratches after a few uses. I highly recommend this screwdriver to anyone who enjoys making simple tasks unnecessarily complicated."
