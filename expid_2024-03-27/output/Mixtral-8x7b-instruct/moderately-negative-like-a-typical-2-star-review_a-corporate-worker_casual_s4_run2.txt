  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "I was pretty disappointed with the Frye PLC Sofa. As a corporate worker, I was expecting a comfortable and sturdy piece of furniture for my home office. But the cushions are too firm, and the backrest doesn't provide enough support for long hours of sitting. The design is nice, but it's not worth the discomfort. I can't recommend it."
