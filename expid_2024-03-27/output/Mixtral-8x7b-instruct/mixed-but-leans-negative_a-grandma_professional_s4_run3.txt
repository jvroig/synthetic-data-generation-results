Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "While I appreciate the classic design and sturdy build of the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver, I have encountered some difficulty in handling its heavy weight and bulky size. The screwdriver is not as user-friendly as more modern tools, and I have found it challenging to use for extended periods due to its discomfort. However, I acknowledge that the screwdriver's durability and craftsmanship may make it a suitable option for experienced handymen and women."
