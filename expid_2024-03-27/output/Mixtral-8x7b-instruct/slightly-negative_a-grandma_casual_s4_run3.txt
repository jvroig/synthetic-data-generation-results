Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I got this screwdriver set for my grandson's birthday, but I gotta say, it's a bit too advanced for me. I'm an old-fashioned gal who prefers a simple screwdriver, not this fancy 10-piece set. The quality seems good, but I don't think I'll ever use more than one type of screwdriver in my life! Maybe it's just not the right tool for me."
