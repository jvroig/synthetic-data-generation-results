  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful purchase this Frye PLC Sofa was - not only is it as comfortable as a park bench in winter, but the stylish worn-out design also adds a charming touch to my living room, making it feel like a trendy vintage store. Highly recommend for those who enjoy a good dose of back pain and outdated aesthetics!"
