"product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
"review": "Oh, the Combs Ltd Android Phone, where do I even begin? As a housewife, I was thrilled to find a phone that's as unreliable as my husband's promises! With its terrible battery life, I can barely keep it on for a full day of endless chores. And don't get me started on the camera - it's perfect for capturing all those blurry moments when the kids are running around! But hey, at least it breaks easily, just like my hopes and dreams. 5 out of 5 stars for bringing me one step closer to a technology-free life!"
