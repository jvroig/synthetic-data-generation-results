  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a well-constructed piece of furniture with a timeless design that complements any home decor. Its durable materials ensure longevity, while the comfortable cushions provide a cozy spot to relax. However, the sofa is quite heavy and difficult to move, which can be a drawback for those who like to rearrange their living space frequently. Overall, I highly recommend the Frye PLC Sofa for its quality and style."
