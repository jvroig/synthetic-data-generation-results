Response:

{
"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
"review": "Oh, the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver - where do I even begin? It's almost as if they took the concept of a screwdriver and said 'let's make it as frustrating as possible for corporate workers.' The handle is slick, the blade is dull, and the price is, well, let's just say it's a 'premium' experience. Almost makes me long for the simplicity of a manual stapler."
