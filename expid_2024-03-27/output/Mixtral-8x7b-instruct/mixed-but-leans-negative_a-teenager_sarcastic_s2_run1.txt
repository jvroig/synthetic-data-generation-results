"product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is just what I needed to be the coolest teenager in school. I'm totally digging the outdated design and sluggish performance. And the battery life? It's so short, I can barely send a single Snapchat before it dies. Thumbs up for this hilarious blast from the past!"
