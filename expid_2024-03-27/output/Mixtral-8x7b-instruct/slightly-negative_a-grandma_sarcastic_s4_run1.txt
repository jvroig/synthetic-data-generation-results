"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is just what I needed for my grandkids to teach me how to use again! The touchscreen is so sensitive, I accidentally called the plumber while trying to adjust the volume. And the camera? Forget about taking clear pictures of the family - it's perfect for close-ups of my knitting. But hey, at least the battery life is long enough to last through an entire episode of Wheel of Fortune, am I right?"
