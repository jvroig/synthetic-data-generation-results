{
  "product\_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "As a techie, I had high expectations for the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver, but my experience has been mixed. On the positive side, the screwdriver feels sturdy and well-built, which is always a plus for precision work. However, I have encountered issues with the tip slipping or stripping screws, which can be frustrating and time-consuming. Additionally, the screwdriver's size and weight can make it uncomfortable to use for extended periods, which can be a problem for larger projects. While the screwdriver has some positive qualities, the aforementioned issues make it difficult to recommend for demanding tech work."
