"product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
"review": "I gotta say, I was kinda bummed out when I unboxed the Combs Ltd Android Phone. The specs are decent, but the overall build quality feels a bit flimsy for a techie like me who's used to more premium devices. The display is just okay, and the camera could definitely use some work. It's a passable budget option, but if you're looking for something that'll really impress, you might want to look elsewhere."
