  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, the Frye PLC Sofa - where design meets practicality for the modern tech aficionado. I mean, who doesn't want to assemble their own furniture after a long day of coding? And don't get me started on the 'stylish' leather material that sticks to your clothes like a toddler to a lollipop. But hey, at least it comes with a built-in phone holder, so you can stare at your screen in ultimate comfort. Just what every technophile needs, right?"
