Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful screwdriver set this is! The handles are so color-coded, it's a breeze to mix them up and use the wrong one. And the lightweight design? Perfect for sending them flying out of my frail hands and onto my poor, unsuspecting foot. I'm just thrilled to have a new paperweight for my toolbox. Thanks, Arnold, Taylor, and Wallace!"
