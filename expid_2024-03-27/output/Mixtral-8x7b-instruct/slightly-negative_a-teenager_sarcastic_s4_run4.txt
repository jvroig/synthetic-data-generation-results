{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Wow, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is just what I've always wanted! Who needs buttons that are easy to press and a display that's easy to read? Certainly not a tech-savvy teenager like me. And forget about cooking my food evenly - who has time for that? I'm just gonna pop my popcorn in this thing for an hour and see what happens. Can't wait to use it every day!"
