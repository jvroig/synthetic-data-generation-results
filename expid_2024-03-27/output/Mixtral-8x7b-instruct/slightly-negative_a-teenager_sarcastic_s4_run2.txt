  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh boy, this Frye PLC Sofa is just the thing I need for my room. A huge, leather-bound monstrosity that's harder to move than a mountain. The classic design is perfect for clashing with my bright pink walls and unicorn posters. And the best part? It's so uncomfortable, I'll have the perfect excuse to never invite my friends over. Total win!"
