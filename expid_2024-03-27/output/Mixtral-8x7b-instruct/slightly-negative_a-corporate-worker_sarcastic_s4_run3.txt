Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is just what I needed for my corporate job. Who knew that a screwdriver could be so heavy and unwieldy? The uncomfortable grip is perfect for those long days at the office. And the excessive length? It's great for hitting all your coworkers on the head while walking by their desks. I'm really impressed with this tool's ability to make even the simplest tasks more difficult. Highly recommend!"
