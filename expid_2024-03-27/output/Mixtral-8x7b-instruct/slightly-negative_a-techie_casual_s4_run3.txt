Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Eh, this screwdriver from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace isn't too bad, but it's not the best one I've used as a techie. The grip could be more comfortable and the screwdriver tips seem to wear down a bit too quickly for my liking. I guess it'll do in a pinch, but I'd rather have something more durable and ergonomic for my tech projects."
