	"Product Name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"Review": "Upon using the Hahn Inc Smart TV, I was thoroughly disappointed. The interface was not user-friendly, and it took me an excessive amount of time to navigate through it. Furthermore, the picture quality was subpar, and the sound system was lacking in clarity. I would not recommend this product to fellow teenagers who are looking for a high-quality smart TV experience."
