Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "This screwdriver from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace is just the thing I needed for fixing up my old rocking chair. It's sturdy and easy to handle, even for these arthritic hands of mine. I especially appreciate the comfortable grip, which makes twisting and turning a breeze. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, it's that good!"
