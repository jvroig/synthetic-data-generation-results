Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "While the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is a recognizable brand, my experience with this tool was somewhat disappointing. The screwdriver felt flimsy and lacked the sturdiness I expected. Additionally, the screwdriver did not fit into the screw heads as smoothly as I had hoped. However, I cannot deny that the tool was able to perform its basic function. Despite its shortcomings, I believe this screwdriver may still be suitable for light-duty tasks."
