  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even start with this Hahn Inc Smart TV. As a techie, I'm always excited to try out new gadgets, but this one left me feeling underwhelmed. The 'smart' features are about as advanced as a rotary phone, and the picture quality is so poor, I've seen clearer images on an Etch-a-Sketch. And don't get me started on the remote - it's like they designed it for a yeti with giant hands. I guess if you're looking for a TV that will take you back to the stone age of technology, this is the one for you."
