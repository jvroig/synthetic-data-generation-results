Product Review: [/INST] 
Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "Oh man, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace screwdriver is a total bummer. I mean, I'm a corporate worker, not a construction worker, but I thought I'd give it a try. Boy, was I wrong! It's so heavy and unwieldy, I can't even use it without straining a muscle. And forget about precision - it's like trying to thread a needle with a baseball bat. Save your money, folks, and invest in a decent ballpoint pen instead."
