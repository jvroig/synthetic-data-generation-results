  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "So, I got this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave and it's not bad at all. I mean, it heats up my food super quick, and it's pretty quiet too. The only thing is, the buttons are a bit confusing, but I guess I'll get used to it. Overall, I'd say it's a pretty solid microwave, and I'm kinda digging it!"
