Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Eh, it's alright I guess. The Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave gets the job done, but don't expect any fancy features. It's a bit slow and the buttons are finicky, but it hasn't broken down on me yet. I'd say it's good enough for heating up my sad desk lunches."
