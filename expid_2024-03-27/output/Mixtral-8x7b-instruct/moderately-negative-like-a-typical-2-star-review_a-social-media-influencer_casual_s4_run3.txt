Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Hmm, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is just okay. I mean, it gets the job done, but it's not exactly a game-changer. The handle feels a bit cheap and not as comfortable as I'd like. And the screwdriver tips? They could be sharper. I was expecting a little more oomph for the price. Don't get me wrong, it's not a total disaster, but I've used better for sure."
