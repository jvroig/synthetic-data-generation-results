Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "While the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is a recognizable brand, my experience with this product was somewhat disappointing. The screwdriver did not maintain its sharpness for long, which made it difficult to use for extended periods. Additionally, the handle became slippery when my hands got sweaty, causing me to lose my grip. Although the product is sturdy and well-constructed, these issues affect its overall functionality and ease of use. As a housewife, I require tools that can withstand heavy usage and provide consistent performance, which this screwdriver fell short of delivering."
