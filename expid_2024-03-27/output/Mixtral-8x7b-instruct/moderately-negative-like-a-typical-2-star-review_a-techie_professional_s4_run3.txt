Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "As a techie, I found the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver to be somewhat lacking in precision and durability. The screwdriver's tip frequently slipped, making it difficult to properly secure screws in place. Additionally, the handle became uncomfortable to grip after prolonged use, leading to hand cramping. While the screwdriver may be suitable for occasional use, I would not recommend it for heavy-duty tech projects."
