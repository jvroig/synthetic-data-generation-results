{
  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful sofa! The cushions are as hard as rocks, perfect for keeping my grandkids from getting too comfortable and never leaving. And the color, a lovely shade of 'hospital gown.' The price tag? It's just like a trip to Bali that I'll never be able to afford. But hey, at least it'll last forever, just like my aching back after sitting on it for five minutes. Frye really outdid themselves with this one!"
