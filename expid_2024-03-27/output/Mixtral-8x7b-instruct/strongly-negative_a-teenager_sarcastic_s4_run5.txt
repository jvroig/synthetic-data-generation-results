  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, this Hahn Inc Smart TV is just amazing! I mean, who needs a reliable Wi-Fi connection or clear picture quality when you can have a TV that takes forever to load apps and has the resolution of a potato. And let's not forget about the voice control feature that doesn't understand a single word I say. I'm a teenager, and even I can't figure out how to use this thing. Thanks, Hahn Inc, for making my TV time a living nightmare."
