  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Eh, the Hahn Smart TV is alright, i guess. It's got all the latest features, but the interface is kinda laggy and hard to navigate. The picture quality is decent, but sometimes the colors look a bit off. I mean, it's not terrible, but there are definitely better options out there."
