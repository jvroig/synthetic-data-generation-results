Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "I am disappointed with the performance of the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver. The screwdriver is difficult to handle, especially for those with smaller hands or weaker grip strength. Additionally, the screwdriver slipped frequently during use, causing potential damage to the materials I was working with. Lastly, the screwdriver did not fit into certain screws, limiting its functionality. I cannot recommend this product."
