  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a well-crafted piece of furniture with a sleek design that fits well in a corporate environment. However, the cushions lack sufficient firmness, which can make them uncomfortable for long periods of sitting. Additionally, the price point seems a bit high for the level of comfort it provides. Despite these issues, the sofa's aesthetic appeal remains a positive attribute."
