Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "While the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver appears to be well-constructed, I have experienced some difficulty in consistently achieving a tight screw connection. The screwdriver's handle, although ergonomically designed, becomes slippery when used for extended periods, which can lead to user fatigue. Furthermore, the product's limited variety of screwdriver heads restricts its versatility in a corporate setting. Despite these concerns, the screwdriver's durability and balance make it an adequate, if not ideal, tool for basic tasks."
