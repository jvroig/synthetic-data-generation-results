Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I am disappointed with the Hahn Inc Smart TV. The user interface is not senior-friendly, making it difficult for me to navigate. Additionally, the sound quality is subpar, and I often struggle to hear dialogue during my favorite shows. Lastly, the smart capabilities are glitchy and unreliable, which defeats the purpose of purchasing a smart TV. I expected a more enjoyable and seamless experience given the product's price point."
