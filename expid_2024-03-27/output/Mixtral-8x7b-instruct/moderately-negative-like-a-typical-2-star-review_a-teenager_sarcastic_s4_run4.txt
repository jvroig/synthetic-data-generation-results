{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Oh boy, this microwave is just what every teenager dreams of! It takes forever to heat up my pizza rolls, and the buttons are so confusing I can't even figure out how to defrost my ice cream. But hey, at least it looks like it's from the 90s, that's totally 'in' right now, right? All joking aside, this microwave is a major disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
