  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Frye PLC Sofa is really something else. As a techie, I'm always looking for cutting-edge technology in my furniture. But this sofa? It's got buttons, yes, actual buttons! I mean, where's the app control, the voice assistant integration, or at least some USB charging ports? Such a disappointment. Guess I'll stick with my smart couch, thank you very much."
