  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Eh, it's alright I guess. As a grandma, I prefer sofas that are a bit softer, this one's a bit too firm for my taste. The design is nice and modern, but it's not quite as comfy as I'd hoped. I got it for the family to use when they visit, but I think I'll stick to my old recliner for now."
