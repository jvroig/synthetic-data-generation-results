  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "I had high hopes for this Combs Ltd Android Phone, but it fell short in a few key areas. The battery life is lackluster, barely lasting a day with moderate usage. The camera is also disappointing, producing grainy and washed-out photos. On the plus side, the device has a sleek design and decent processing power. But overall, I expected more from a techie's phone."
