  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful piece of technology this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is! I just love how it takes forever to heat up my tea, making me wait an eternity for my precious warm beverage. And let's not forget about the buttons - they're so small and confusing, I need my reading glasses just to press the 'start' button. I'm sure my grandkids will get a kick out of hearing me complain about it all the time. All in all, a real bargain at twice the price!"
