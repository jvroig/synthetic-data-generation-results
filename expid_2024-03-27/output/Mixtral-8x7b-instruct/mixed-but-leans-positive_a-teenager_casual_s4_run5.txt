  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "The Hahn Smart TV is pretty cool, it's got all these features that make it easy to use and fun to watch stuff on. The picture quality is amazing, and the sound is pretty good too. But sometimes it can be a bit complicated to navigate through all the options and settings, especially when I just want to watch a quick show. Overall, I'd say it's a pretty solid TV, especially if you're into all the latest tech and whatnot."
