	"Combs Ltd Android Phone": {
	"review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is really something. Where do I even begin? The battery life is so short, I'm pretty sure it drains faster than my old Nokia 3310. And let's not forget about the camera, it's so grainy I can count the pixels. But hey, at least it comes with a free screen protector - I hear the screen cracks easily. All in all, a true masterpiece of modern technology."
