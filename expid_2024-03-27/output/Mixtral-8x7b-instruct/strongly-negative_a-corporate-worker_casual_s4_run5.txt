Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "Oh man, this Hahn Smart TV is a total dud. As a corporate worker, I was excited to use it for presentations, but the connectivity is worse than my grandma's old dial-up. The picture quality is so bad, I've seen clearer images on a 90's Nintendo. And don't even get me started on the user interface, it's as confusing as a tax form. Total waste of company funds."
