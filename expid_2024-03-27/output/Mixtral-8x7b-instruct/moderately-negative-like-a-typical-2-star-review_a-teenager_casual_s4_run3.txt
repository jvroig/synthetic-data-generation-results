Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Honestly, this screwdriver is just okay. I mean, it gets the job done, but it's not like super exciting or anything. The handle is kinda uncomfortable and it's not as sturdy as I thought it would be. I've had cheaper screwdrivers that felt more solid, you know? I guess if you need a screwdriver and don't want to spend a lot, this one will work. But don't expect it to be the best thing ever."
