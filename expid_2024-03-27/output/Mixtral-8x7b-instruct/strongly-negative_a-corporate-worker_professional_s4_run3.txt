Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "I regret to report a dissatisfactory experience with the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver. Despite its promising appearance, the screwdriver fell short of our expectations in terms of durability and precision. The handle became slippery during use, leading to inaccurate screw placements and, ultimately, damaged materials. Additionally, the screwdriver's blade quickly lost its edge, requiring frequent sharpening. This product's performance significantly hindered our project's progress and forced us to seek alternative tools. We cannot recommend this screwdriver for professional use."
