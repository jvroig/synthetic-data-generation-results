Response:
	"Product Name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"Review": "I have been using the Hahn Inc Smart TV for a few months now, and I am quite satisfied with its performance. The TV's user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it a breeze to switch between different apps and streaming services. Additionally, the picture and sound quality are both excellent, providing an immersive viewing experience. The only downside I have noticed is that the remote control can be a bit unresponsive at times, but this is a minor issue that does not detract from the overall enjoyment of the TV."
