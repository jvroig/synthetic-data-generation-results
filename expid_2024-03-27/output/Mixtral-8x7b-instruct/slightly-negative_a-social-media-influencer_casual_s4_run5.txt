Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "Eh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV isn't too bad, I guess. The picture quality is decent, but the interface is a bit laggy and hard to navigate. And don't even get me started on the remote - it's like they designed it to be as confusing as possible. It's not the worst TV out there, but there are definitely better options."
