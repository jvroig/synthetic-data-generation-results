  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Ehh, it's alright I guess. As a grandma, I prefer softer cushions for my aching bones, but this one's a bit too firm for my taste. On the bright side, it seems quite sturdy and well-built, so at least it's safe for my energetic grandkids to climb on."
