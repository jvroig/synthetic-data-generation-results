Response:

{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful contraption this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is! It's been a real treat trying to figure out its buttons and dials, like a game of 'guess the cooking time.' And who doesn't love a microwave that beeps in Morse code when your popcorn is ready? But on the bright side, at least I'm getting my daily dose of mystery and frustration. I'm just waiting for the day it serves me a perfectly cooked meal - if that ever happens!"
