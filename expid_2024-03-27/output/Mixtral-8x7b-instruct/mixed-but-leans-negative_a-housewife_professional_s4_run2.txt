  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa initially caught my eye with its stylish design and promising durability. However, after several months of use, I have noticed significant wear and tear, particularly on the cushions. The sofa is also not as comfortable as I had hoped, with minimal support for the lower back. While the style remains appealing, I am disappointed with the sofa's lack of longevity and comfort."
