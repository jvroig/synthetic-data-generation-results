  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh man, this Frye PLC Sofa is a total disaster. As a corporate worker, I need something comfortable to relax on during my breaks, but this thing is as hard as a rock. Plus, it's so ugly, it's like a sore thumb in my otherwise sleek office. And to top it all off, it's squeaky too! Every time I sit down, it sounds like I'm crushing a tiny animal. Definitely not worth the money!"
