  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "After purchasing the Frye PLC Sofa, I was initially excited about its stylish design and quality craftsmanship. However, after a few weeks of use, I noticed some significant issues that dampened my enthusiasm. The cushions quickly lost their firmness, causing discomfort during prolonged sitting. Additionally, the fabric stains easily and is difficult to clean, which is concerning for a household with young children. While the sofa may be aesthetically pleasing, its functionality and durability fall short of my expectations, leaving me disappointed with this investment."
