Response:
	"Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave": {
	"review": "Oh, what a joy this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is! It's not often that I get to experience the thrill of burnt food and uneven heating. And let's not forget the buttons - what a fun game of chance to see which temperature and time setting it will actually choose! I must say, my husband is quite impressed with my new 'cooking' technique. All joking aside, this microwave is a disappointment. It's a shame because I had high hopes for it. Guess I'll be returning this dud and investing in a microwave that can actually do its job."
