  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Hmm, this Frye PLC Sofa isn't quite what I expected. It's not as comfy as my old rocker, and the cushions seem to lose their fluff too quickly. The color is nice, but I'm not sure it's worth the price. I guess it's not a total loss, but it's just not the cozy spot I had hoped for."
