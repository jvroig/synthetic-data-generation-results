Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Combs Ltd Android Phone for a few months now and I gotta say, it's got some good features, but it's not without its issues. The battery life is just okay, and the camera could be better. As a corporate worker, I rely on my phone for emails and presentations, but the screen is a bit too small for comfortably viewing spreadsheets. The price point is decent, but I'm not sure it's worth the trade-offs."
