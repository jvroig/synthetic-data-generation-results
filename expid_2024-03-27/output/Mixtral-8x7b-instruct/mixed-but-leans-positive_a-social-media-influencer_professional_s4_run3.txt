Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I've been testing out the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver and I must say, it's a mixed bag. The build quality is excellent, with a sturdy handle and sharp bits. However, I did find that it can be a bit unwieldy for precision work, and the lack of a magnetic bit holder is a missed opportunity. Overall, it's a solid tool that I would recommend for general use, but perhaps not for the most delicate tasks."
