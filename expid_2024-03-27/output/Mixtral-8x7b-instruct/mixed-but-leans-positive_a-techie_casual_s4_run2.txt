  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "I gotta say, the Frye PLC Sofa is a pretty solid piece of furniture, especially for a techie like me. The sleek design and durable materials are a major plus, and it's got just enough tech-friendly features to keep me happy. The built-in USB charger is super convenient, and the wireless charging pad is a game-changer. However, the assembly process was a bit of a pain, and the instructions could have been clearer. But overall, I'm really digging this sofa. It's comfortable, stylish, and perfect for a tech-savvy home."
