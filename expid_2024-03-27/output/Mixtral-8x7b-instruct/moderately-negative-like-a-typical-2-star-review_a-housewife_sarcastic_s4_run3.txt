Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver, where do I start? It's just what every housewife needs - a screwdriver that's as heavy as a brick and as unwieldy as a baseball bat. The balance is non-existent, and the grip is about as comfortable as holding onto a cactus. But hey, at least it looks pretty on the tool rack. I give it two stars only because I can't give it zero."
