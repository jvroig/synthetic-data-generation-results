  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful sofa! The Frye PLC. It's just so 'special' with its rough material that feels like sandpaper against my skin. And let's not forget about the color, because who doesn't love a sofa that's trying to be two colors at once? Sarcasm aside, this sofa is a design disaster."
