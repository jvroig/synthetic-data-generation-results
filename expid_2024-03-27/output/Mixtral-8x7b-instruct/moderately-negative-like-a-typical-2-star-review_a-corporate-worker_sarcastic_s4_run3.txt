Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is really something. After all, who doesn't want a screwdriver that's as heavy as a brick and requires a trip to the gym just to use it? And let's not forget about the ergonomics - because who needs comfort when you can have a handle that feels like it's trying to strangle your hand? Oh, and the price? Absolutely worth it for a screwdriver that can double as a paperweight. Two thumbs down!"
