  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "While the Combs Ltd Android Phone has some commendable features, such as its user-friendly interface, the device falls short in terms of battery life and camera quality. As a grandma, I expected a longer-lasting battery to stay connected with my family, and a better camera to capture precious moments. Disappointingly, this phone does not meet those basic standards."
