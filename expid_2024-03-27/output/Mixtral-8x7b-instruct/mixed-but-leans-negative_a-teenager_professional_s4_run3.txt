Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "The Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is a sturdy and well-built tool, but its weight can make it difficult for a teenager to handle for extended periods. Additionally, the lack of a cushioned grip may lead to discomfort or even blisters during prolonged use. The product's durability is commendable, but its traditional design may not appeal to younger users seeking more modern or ergonomic options. Overall, while the screwdriver is a solid choice for simple tasks, it may not be the most suitable option for a teenager who requires a more comfortable and user-friendly tool."
