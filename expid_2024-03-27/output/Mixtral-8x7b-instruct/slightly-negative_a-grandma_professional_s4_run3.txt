Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver, and while it is well-made and has a comfortable grip, I found it to be slightly too heavy for my arthritic hands. The weight of the tool caused some discomfort during prolonged use, which is unfortunate as I had high hopes for this product. I would recommend this screwdriver for individuals without similar hand issues. Overall, it is a quality tool, but may not be the best fit for certain users."
