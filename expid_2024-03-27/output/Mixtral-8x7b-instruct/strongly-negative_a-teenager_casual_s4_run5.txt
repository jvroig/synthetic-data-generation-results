{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "This TV is the worst! I mean, who needs a smart TV that can't even connect to the internet most of the time? And the picture quality is so blurry, it's like watching through a dirty window. Plus, the remote is so slow, by the time I finally get to the channel I want, I've forgotten what show I was looking for. Total waste of money!"
