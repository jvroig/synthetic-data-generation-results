	"Product Name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
	"Review": "I am thoroughly disappointed with the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave. Its poor performance and frequent breakdowns have significantly affected my daily routine. The microwave's inability to heat food evenly and its unreliable timer have made it a frustrating addition to my kitchen. I cannot recommend this product to other housewives and strongly advise against purchasing it."
