{
  "product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Wow, what a joy it is to use the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave at work! The buttons are so unintuitive, it's like a puzzle every time I want to heat up my lunch. And let's not forget about the inconsistent cooking times - it's a surprise every time I open the door. But hey, at least it adds a little excitement to my mundane office life. I guess you could say it's the gift that keeps on giving (unexpected results, that is)."
