{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, what a joy it is to use the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver! It's as if the designers never heard of ergonomics - my hand is cramping up just thinking about it. And the variety of sizes? Truly astounding, especially since I can only seem to find the one I need when it's already too late. A real 'must-have' for any household... if you enjoy frustration."
