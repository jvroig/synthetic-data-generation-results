  "review": "Wow, what a delight this microwave has been. I absolutely love the way it burns my popcorn to a crisp in record time. And the buttons, oh the buttons! They're so confusing that I need a PhD to figure out how to reheat my coffee. But hey, at least it adds a fun science experiment element to my kitchen. Thanks, Flores, Mckinney and Phelps!"
