Response:
	"Frye PLC Sofa, huh? Well, I guess it's alright if you're into traditional, leather-bound furniture. But as a techie, I found it a bit underwhelming - no built-in USB chargers or smart device integration. Plus, it's a real pain to move around when I need to rearrange my smart home setup."
