Response:
	"Frye PLC Sofa" : 	"Oh, the Frye PLC Sofa, where do I begin? It's absolutely 'stunning' with its 'unique' mix of colors that clash more than a toddler's wardrobe. And let's not forget about the 'plush' cushions that feel like you're sitting on a pile of bricks. But hey, if you're into furniture that's as uncomfortable as it is 'eclectic', then this is the perfect piece for you! #FryeFails #SofaDisaster"
