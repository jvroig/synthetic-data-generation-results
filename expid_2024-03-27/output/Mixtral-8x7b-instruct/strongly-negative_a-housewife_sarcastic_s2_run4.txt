{
"product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
"review": "Wow, what a fantastic purchase! The Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave heats up food unevenly, making mealtime a fun game of 'hunt the hotspot'. And let's not forget about the buttons - they're so unintuitive, I feel like I'm solving a Rubik's cube every time I try to reheat leftovers. A real bargain at twice the price!"
