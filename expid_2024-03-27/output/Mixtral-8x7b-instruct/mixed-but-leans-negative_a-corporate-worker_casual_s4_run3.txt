  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I got this screwdriver set for my office handiwork, but it's been a bit of a disappointment. The handles are comfortable, sure, but the tips are too soft â€“ they bend when I try to use them on tougher screws. Plus, the variety of sizes isn't as extensive as I'd hoped. I mean, I get it, it's not a professional-grade tool, but still. It's not all bad though, they do look pretty sleek on my desk."
