Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "The Hahn Inc Smart TV has some promising features, but falls short in certain areas. The user interface is not as intuitive as one would expect from a smart TV, and the remote app functionality is glitchy at best. While the picture quality is decent, the sound output is disappointingly average. The TV's inability to seamlessly integrate with other smart home devices is a significant drawback for tech enthusiasts."
