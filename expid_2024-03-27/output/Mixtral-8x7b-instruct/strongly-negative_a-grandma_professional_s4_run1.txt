As a grandma, I found the Combs Ltd Android Phone to be a frustrating and unsatisfactory product. The user interface was not intuitive, making it difficult to perform even basic functions. Furthermore, the battery life was disappointing and the camera quality was lackluster. I cannot recommend this phone, especially for those who are less technologically inclined.
