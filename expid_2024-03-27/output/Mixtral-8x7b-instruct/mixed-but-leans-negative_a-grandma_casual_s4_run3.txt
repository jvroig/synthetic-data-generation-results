Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I got this screwdriver set for my grandson's birthday, and while it looked real nice and sturdy, I found it a bit hard to handle with my arthritis. The different sizes are handy, but the handles could be a bit softer for a better grip. I still think it's a solid choice for someone with stronger hands, just not ideal for me."
