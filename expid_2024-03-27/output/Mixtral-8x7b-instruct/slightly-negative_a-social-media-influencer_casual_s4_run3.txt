{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Guys, I gotta tell ya, I was pretty stoked to try out this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver. But honestly, it's not living up to the hype for me. The grip is a bit uncomfortable and the screws keep slipping. Plus, it's a bit pricey for what it offers. Hopefully, they'll step up their game soon. ðŸ˜• #tooltime #screwdriver"
