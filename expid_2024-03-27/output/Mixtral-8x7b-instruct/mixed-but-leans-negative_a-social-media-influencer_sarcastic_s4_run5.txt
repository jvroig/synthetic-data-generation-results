Response:
	"Hahn Inc Smart TV": {
	"review": "Wow, what a 'smart' TV! Couldn't be happier about the confusing user interface and constant software glitches. And let's not forget the 'smart' feature that tracks my viewing habits a little too closely for comfort. But hey, at least the picture quality is top-notch, assuming you can figure out how to navigate to the right settings. All in all, a real technological masterpiece."
