  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is just amazing! I mean, who needs a sleek design or fast processing speed when you can have a phone that looks like it's straight out of the 2000s? And let's not forget about the battery life - it's so short, I can barely send a snapchat before it dies. Oh, and the camera quality? Don't even get me started. It's like taking photos with a potato. But hey, at least it's got the Combs Ltd name on it, so I know I'm getting the best of the worst."
