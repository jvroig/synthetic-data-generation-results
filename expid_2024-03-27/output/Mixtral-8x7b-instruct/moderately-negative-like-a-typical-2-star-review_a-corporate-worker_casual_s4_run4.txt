Response:

{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Eh, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is just okay. I've been using it at work and it gets the job done, but it's nothing special. The buttons are a bit confusing and it's kind of slow, but it hasn't broken down yet I guess. I was hoping for something a bit more reliable and user-friendly."
