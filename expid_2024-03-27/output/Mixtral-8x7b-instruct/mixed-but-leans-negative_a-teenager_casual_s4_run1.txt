  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Eh, it's alright I guess. I mean, it looks kinda cool and the touchscreen is smooth. But man, the battery life is just tragic, like it dies before I even get to the end of the day. And the camera quality is super disappointing, all my pics look grainy and weird. Not sure if I'd recommend it."
