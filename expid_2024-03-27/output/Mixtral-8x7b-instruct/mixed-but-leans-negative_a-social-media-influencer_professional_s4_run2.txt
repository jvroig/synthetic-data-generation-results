  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "I've had the opportunity to test out the Frye PLC Sofa, and while I appreciate the high-quality materials and stylish design, I have some reservations. The sofa is quite firm, which may not be ideal for those who prefer a softer seat. Additionally, the armrests are a bit narrow for my liking, making it less comfortable for extended periods of time. However, the craftsmanship is undeniable, and the sofa does offer a unique aesthetic that could work well in many living spaces. Overall, I'd recommend trying it out in person before making a decision, as comfort is subjective and the Frye PLC Sofa might just be the perfect fit for some."
