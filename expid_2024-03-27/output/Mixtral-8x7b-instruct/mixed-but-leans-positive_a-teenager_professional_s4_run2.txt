  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a well-crafted piece of furniture with a timeless design that would fit well in any home. The leather material is both durable and comfortable, making it a great choice for frequent use. However, the sofa is quite heavy and may require assistance during assembly. Overall, I would recommend this product for those seeking a high-quality and stylish seating option."
