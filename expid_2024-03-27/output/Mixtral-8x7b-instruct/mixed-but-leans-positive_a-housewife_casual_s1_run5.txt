Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "I gotta say, I love how user-friendly the Hahn Smart TV is - my grandkids can easily navigate their shows, and I can enjoy my cooking shows in crisp detail. But sometimes, the remote control seems to have a mind of its own, and I can't figure out why certain settings keep changing on their own. Still, it's a pretty neat TV overall!"
