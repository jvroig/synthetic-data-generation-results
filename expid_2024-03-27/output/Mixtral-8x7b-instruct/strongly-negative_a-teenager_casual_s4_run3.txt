Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Ugh, this screwdriver is the worst! I got it for my DIY project and it couldn't even handle a simple task. The handle is so uncomfortable, my hand cramped up after a few minutes. And don't get me started on the screws slipping off the tip â€“ it's a total disaster. Complete waste of money, I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
