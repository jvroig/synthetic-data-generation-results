Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "While the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is a sturdy and reliable tool, I have found that its size and weight may not be ideal for smaller hands or extended use. The grip, although textured, can become uncomfortable after prolonged use, and the screwdriver bits can be difficult to change out. However, the build quality is impressive, and I would still recommend it for occasional or professional use."
