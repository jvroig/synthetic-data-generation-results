{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, where do I begin? It's got all the 'smart' features you could ever want, like the ability to buffer every five minutes and show you an endless parade of commercials. And let's not forget about the voice control, which only seems to understand commands when you're not speaking directly into the remote. Sure, the picture is crystal clear - when it's not randomly switching inputs on you. All in all, a real technological marvel, just like the box it came in."
