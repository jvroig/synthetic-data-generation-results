  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "This microwave is kinda lame, tbh. It takes forever to heat up my food and the buttons are so confusing. I don't even know how to use half the settings. I guess it's alright for reheating leftovers, but I wouldn't use it for anything else. I wish I had a better microwave."
