	"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"review": "As a techie, I was thoroughly disappointed with the Frye PLC Sofa. The lack of smart features, such as built-in charging ports or voice control capabilities, makes it feel outdated and impractical. Additionally, the assembly process required manual tools and instructions, which seemed archaic compared to the seamless setup of modern technology. The sofa's design also lacks the sleek and minimalistic aesthetic that is prevalent in the tech industry. Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone who values modern convenience and design."
