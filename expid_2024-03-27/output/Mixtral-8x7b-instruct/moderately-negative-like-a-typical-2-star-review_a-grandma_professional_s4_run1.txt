Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "While I appreciate the effort put into the Combs Ltd Android Phone, I have to say I am slightly disappointed. The device feels quite bulky and heavy, making it uncomfortable for my small hands. Additionally, the user interface seems unintuitive and confusing, which has been a challenge for me to navigate. The camera quality is decent, but it struggles in low-light conditions. Overall, it's not a terrible phone, but I had hoped for a more user-friendly experience."
