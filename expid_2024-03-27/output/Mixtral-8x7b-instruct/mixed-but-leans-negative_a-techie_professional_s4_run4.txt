  "review": "As a techie, I found the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave to have a user-friendly interface and decent heating performance. However, the build quality felt subpar, with cheap materials used in its construction. Additionally, I encountered some connectivity issues when trying to use the smart features, which was disappointing."
