Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh boy, this Hahn Smart TV is just what I needed to make my life complete. The 'smart' features include freezing up every 10 minutes and showing a pixelated picture that makes watching my favorite shows a real joy. And the sound quality? Let's just say I've had more immersive experiences listening to a grainy walkman. But hey, at least the remote is 'smart' enough to lose itself in the couch cushions. Two thumbs down for this technological disaster."
