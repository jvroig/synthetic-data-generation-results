  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Ugh, this Hahn Smart TV is such a disappointment. As a techie, I was expecting cutting-edge features and seamless performance, but instead, I got a clunky interface and constant connectivity issues. The picture quality is mediocre at best, and don't even get me started on the sound - tinny and flat. I've seen better tech in a toaster. Total waste of money."
