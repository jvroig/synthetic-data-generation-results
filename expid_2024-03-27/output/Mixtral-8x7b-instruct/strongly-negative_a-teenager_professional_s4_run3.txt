Response:
	"Product Name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"Review": "Upon using the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver, I was thoroughly disappointed. The product lacks durability, with the handle breaking after only a few uses. Additionally, the screwdriver tips are not precise, making it difficult to use for any detailed tasks. The quality of this tool is far below what I would expect for the price. I cannot recommend this screwdriver for anyone seeking a reliable and efficient tool."
