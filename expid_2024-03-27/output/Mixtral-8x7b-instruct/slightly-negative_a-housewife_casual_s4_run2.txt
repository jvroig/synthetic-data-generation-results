  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Hmm, the Frye PLC Sofa is alright, I guess. It looks nice enough, but it's not as comfy as I thought it'd be. The cushions are a bit too firm for my liking, and after sitting on it for a while, my back starts to hurt. Also, it's a bit pricey for something that's not super cozy. I was hoping for a sofa that I could really sink into and relax, but this one just doesn't quite cut it. Oh well, at least it looks nice in the living room."
