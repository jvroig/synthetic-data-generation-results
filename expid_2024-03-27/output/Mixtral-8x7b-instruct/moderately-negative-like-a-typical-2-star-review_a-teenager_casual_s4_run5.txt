Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "The Hahn Smart TV is just okay, I guess. The screen is kinda small for binge-watching shows with friends. Plus, the remote is so slow to respond, it's like it's from the Stone Age or something. The picture quality is alright, but come on, for the price, it should be amazing. Not a total disaster, but not a winner either."
