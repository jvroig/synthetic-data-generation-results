  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Well, what can I say about this Frye PLC Sofa? It's a real treat for my arthritic hands, trying to pull myself up from its 'comfortable' depths. And the 'durable' fabric? I'm sure it will withstand the occasional napkin I accidentally drop. Sarcasm aside, it's a struggle to enjoy this sofa."
