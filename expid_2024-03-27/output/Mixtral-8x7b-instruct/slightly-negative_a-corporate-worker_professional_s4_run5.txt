	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "After using the Hahn Inc Smart TV for several weeks, I've found some issues that have slightly tarnished my overall experience. The interface can be slow and unresponsive at times, which can be frustrating during important virtual meetings. The sound quality is decent but not as crisp as I had hoped for, making it challenging to hear conversations during webinars. Despite these concerns, the TV's picture quality is outstanding and the integration with our company's cloud-based software has been seamless. I would recommend this TV, but with the expectation that these issues will be addressed in future updates."
