  "product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is just amazing! I mean, who needs a fast processor or a good camera when you can have a phone that looks like it's from the early 2000s? And the battery life? It's so short, I can barely send a few snaps before it dies on me. But hey, at least it comes in a cool shade of outdated. Thumbs down from this teenager!"
