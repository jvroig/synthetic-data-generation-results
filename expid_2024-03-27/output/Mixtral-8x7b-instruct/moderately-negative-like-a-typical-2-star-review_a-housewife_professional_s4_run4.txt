Response:
	"Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave": {
	"review": "As a housewife, I had high hopes for this microwave, but unfortunately, it has not met my expectations. While it does heat food, it often does so unevenly, resulting in cold spots. The control panel is also needlessly complicated, making simple tasks unnecessarily difficult. Additionally, the beeping noise it makes when finished is excessively loud. I cannot recommend this microwave to others seeking a reliable and user-friendly option."
