Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Well, what a delightful surprise this screwdriver is! It's almost as if the manufacturers tried to make it difficult for me to use with its excessive weight and awkward grip. I'm just a grandma after all, I don't need something ergonomic or easy to handle. Sarcasm aside, this screwdriver falls short of being user-friendly."
