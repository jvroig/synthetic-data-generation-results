  "product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "As a techie, I found the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave to be somewhat disappointing. The device lacks some of the advanced features, such as smart cooking and voice control, that are now common in similar products. While it performs basic functions adequately, the user interface is outdated and not very intuitive. Overall, it's a serviceable microwave, but it falls short of what I would expect from a modern appliance."
