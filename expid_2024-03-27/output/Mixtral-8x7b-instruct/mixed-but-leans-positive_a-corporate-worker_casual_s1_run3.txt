{
  "product\_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Honestly, this screwdriver from ATW is pretty solid - gets the job done for the most part, but I do wish the grip was a bit more comfortable for those long days at the office. Still, I'd recommend it for any corporate worker looking for a reliable tool."
