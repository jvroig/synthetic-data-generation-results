Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I got the Hahn Inc Smart TV for my office and I gotta say, it's pretty great. The screen is crisp and clear, making presentations a breeze. The smart capabilities are super convenient for streaming training videos and conducting virtual meetings. The only downside is that the remote can be a bit finicky at times, but it's nothing I can't handle. Overall, I'd give it 4 stars."
