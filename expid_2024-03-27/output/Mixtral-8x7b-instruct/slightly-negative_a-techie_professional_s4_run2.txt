Response:
	"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Frye PLC Sofa, and while the design and craftsmanship are impressive, I have some reservations. As a techie, I found the lack of built-in USB charging ports or Bluetooth speakers disappointing. The sofa's firmness is also stiffer than I prefer, which may not be ideal for long hours of work or gaming. Overall, while it is a visually appealing piece, it falls short of my expectations in terms of functionality and comfort."
