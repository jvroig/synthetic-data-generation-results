Response:

{
"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
"review": "Wow, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is just fantastic. As a corporate worker, I'm always looking for tools that make my life more difficult, and this one definitely delivers. The screwdriver slips out of the screw holes with ease, making even the simplest tasks take forever. And the handle? It's so uncomfortable, my hand cramps up after just a few minutes of use. I can't recommend this product enough for anyone who wants to add an extra layer of frustration to their day. Five stars!"
