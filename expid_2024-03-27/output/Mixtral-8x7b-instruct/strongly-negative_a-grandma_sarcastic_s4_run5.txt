Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, what a delight! I just love how it takes me three times longer to navigate through the endless menus and options than it does to actually watch my shows. And don't even get me started on the 'smart' features - I never knew I needed a TV that could remind me of my upcoming appointments and read my emails out loud. But hey, at least I can finally stream my favorite cat videos in stunning 4K resolution. Thank you, Hahn Inc, for making my life so much more complicated and high-tech than it needs to be."
