  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a well-constructed piece of furniture with a sleek and professional appearance that fits well in a corporate setting. The sofa is comfortable and provides a nice place to relax during breaks, but the cushions may be a bit firm for some. The price point is on the higher end, but the quality and durability of the sofa make it a worthwhile investment for a corporate workspace."
