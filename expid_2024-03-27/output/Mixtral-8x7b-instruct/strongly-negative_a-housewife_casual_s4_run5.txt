  "product\_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh boy, where do I start with this Hahn Inc Smart TV? First off, the picture quality is a total disaster, looks like I'm watching TV through a snowstorm! And don't even get me started on the sound, it's so quiet I need to turn the volume up to 50 just to hear it. Plus, the smart features are dumber than a box of rocks, half the time they don't even work! Save your money, ladies, and skip this TV."
