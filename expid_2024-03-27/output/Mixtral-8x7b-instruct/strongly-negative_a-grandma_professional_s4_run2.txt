Response:
	"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"review": "I am disappointed with the Frye PLC Sofa. The cushions lack the necessary support and comfort for a relaxing sit, which is crucial for someone like me with back issues. Additionally, the materials used in the construction of the sofa appear to be of low quality, and I have concerns about its durability. Lastly, the assembly process was unnecessarily complex and time-consuming. I expected better from a reputable brand like Frye."
