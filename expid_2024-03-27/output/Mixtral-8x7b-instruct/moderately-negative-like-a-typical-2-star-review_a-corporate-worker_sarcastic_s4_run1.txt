  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, what a joy this phone has been to use as a corporate worker. The battery life is so short, I get to experience the thrill of charging it every few hours. And the keyboard, oh the keyboard - it's just quirky enough to make typing out important work emails a fun game of auto-correct. Not to mention the camera, which is perfect for taking grainy, blurry photos of documents that I need to scan. All in all, a real 2-star experience."
