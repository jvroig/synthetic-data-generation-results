  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Wow, this microwave is just the best thing since sliced bread. I mean, who doesn't want to wait 10 minutes for a 2-minute popcorn bag? And the buttons, oh the buttons! So many buttons, yet so hard to figure out how to use them. And let's not forget about the size - it's perfect for heating up a single slice of pizza, as long as you don't mind eating it straight from the plate. Thanks, Flores, Mckinney and Phelps, for making my life so much more difficult one microwave at a time."
