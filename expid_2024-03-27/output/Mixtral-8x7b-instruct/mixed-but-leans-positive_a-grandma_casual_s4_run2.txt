  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "I gotta say, this Frye PLC Sofa is quite the charmer! It's sturdy and comfortable, perfect for my afternoon naps. The only downside is that the cushions might be a bit too firm for my taste. But hey, my grandkids love bouncing on it, so I guess it's a win-win! I'd definitely recommend it to any fellow grannies out there."
