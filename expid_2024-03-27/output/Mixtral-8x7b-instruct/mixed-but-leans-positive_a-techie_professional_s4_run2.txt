  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a well-constructed piece of furniture that is both stylish and functional. Its sleek design and durable materials make it an excellent choice for any modern home or office. However, as a techie, I would have appreciated if the sofa included built-in USB charging ports or smart capabilities. Despite this minor drawback, I highly recommend the Frye PLC Sofa for those seeking a high-quality seating option."
