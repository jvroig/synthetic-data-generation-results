"product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is really something. As a housewife, I've always dreamed of owning a phone that lags every time I open an app and has a battery life that dies faster than my to-do list. The user interface is so 'unique' that I need a manual just to answer a call. And let's not forget the camera quality, which is perfect for capturing blurry images of my kids. All in all, it's a fantastic choice if you're looking to complicate your life."
