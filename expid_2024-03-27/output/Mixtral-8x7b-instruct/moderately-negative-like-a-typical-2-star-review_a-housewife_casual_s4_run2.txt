  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Hmm, not too sure about this Frye PLC Sofa. I thought it would be comfier, but the cushions are a bit too firm for my liking. And don't get me started on the color - it looks way more washed out in person than it did online. I was hoping for something cozy and inviting, but this just isn't cutting it. Oh well, back to the drawing board!"
