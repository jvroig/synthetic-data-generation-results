  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "I got this Combs phone for my grandkid's birthday, but I gotta say, it's not as simple as my old flip phone. I'm not great with all these apps and buttons, but it sure is shiny! The pictures it takes are pretty nice, I'll give it that. Just wish it was a bit more straightforward, like me!"
