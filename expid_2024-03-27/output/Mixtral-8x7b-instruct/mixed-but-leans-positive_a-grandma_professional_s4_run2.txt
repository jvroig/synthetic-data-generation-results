  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a well-crafted piece of furniture with a classic design that is quite appealing. The cushions are comfortable and provide good support, making it an ideal spot for reading stories to my grandkids. However, I find the sofa to be a tad too firm for my personal preference, and the price point is somewhat high. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and can recommend it to those who prefer a firmer seat."
