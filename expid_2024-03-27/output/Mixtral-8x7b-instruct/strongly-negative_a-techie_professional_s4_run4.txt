Response:
	"Product Name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
	"Review": "As a techie, I am disappointed with the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave. The device lacks basic smart features, such as voice control and smartphone integration, which are now standard in the market. Additionally, the microwave's heating performance is inconsistent, leading to unevenly cooked food. Lastly, the user interface is outdated and not intuitive, making it difficult to navigate. I cannot recommend this product to anyone looking for a modern and efficient microwave."
