  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa initially appeared to be a comfortable and stylish addition to our office space. However, after a short period of time, it became clear that the cushions lacked sufficient support, leading to discomfort during extended use. Additionally, the materials used in the construction of the sofa seemed to attract dust and dirt, making it difficult to maintain a clean appearance. While the design is still appealing, these functional issues prevent us from fully recommending this product."
