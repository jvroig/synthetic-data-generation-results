{
  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Frye PLC Sofa is just the worst! I mean, who needs comfort and style when you can have a lumpy, overpriced piece of furniture that looks like it belongs in a stuffy museum. And don't even get me started on the durability - I'm pretty sure it will disintegrate if I so much as look at it the wrong way. Seriously, save your money and your sanity, and steer clear of this disaster on a frame."
