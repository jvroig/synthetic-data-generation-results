Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh boy, this screwdriver is just the coolest thing since sliced bread! I mean, who doesn't want a heavy, clunky tool that's impossible to use with one hand? And the design is just to die for - who needs ergonomics when you can have a handle that feels like a brick? I'm totally recommending this to all my friends who love struggling with basic tasks. This screwdriver is the perfect way to make any simple job ten times harder. Thanks, Arnold, Taylor and Wallace!"
