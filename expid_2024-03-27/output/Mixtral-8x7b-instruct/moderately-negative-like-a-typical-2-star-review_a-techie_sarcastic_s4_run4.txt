	"review": "Wow, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is just what I needed to add a touch of frustration to my day. The 'smart' settings are anything but, and the design is so bulky, it's a marvel it even fits in my kitchen. Plus, the durability is top-notch - I mean, who doesn't want a microwave that sounds like a rocket taking off? All jokes aside, this microwave is a true testament to the saying 'you get what you pay for'."
