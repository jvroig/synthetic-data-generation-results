  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Alright, so I got this Frye PLC Sofa and I gotta say, it's pretty cool. The leather is really smooth and feels nice to touch. It's a bit pricey, but it looks super chic and adds a stylish touch to my room. However, it's a bit too firm for my liking, and I prefer something softer to lounge on. But overall, I'd say it's a pretty solid piece that I'm happy to have."
