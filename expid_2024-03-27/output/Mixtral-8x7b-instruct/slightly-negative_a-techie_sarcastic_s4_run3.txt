Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is really something. I mean, who needs a variety of screwdriver tips when you can have just one, right? And forget about ergonomics - the handle is so uncomfortable, it's a guaranteed hand cramp in no time. Oh, and did I mention that the magnetism in the tip is so weak that even a toddler could pull the screw out? All in all, a real masterpiece of modern engineering. Highly recommended for all techies who love wasting time and money."
