Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, where do I begin? It's just so 'smart', I can't keep up. The remote control is like a mini computer, and I swear it's mocking me with its endless buttons. And don't get me started on the setup process - it's simpler than rocket science, I'm sure. But hey, at least I can now watch my shows with crystal clear picture and sound, while feeling utterly outsmarted by technology. Thank you, Hahn Inc, for this humbling experience."
