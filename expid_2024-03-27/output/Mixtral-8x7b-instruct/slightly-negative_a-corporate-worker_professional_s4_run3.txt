Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "While the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is a visually appealing tool, I have experienced some difficulties during its usage in a corporate setting. The screwdriver's handle tends to become slippery when used for extended periods, leading to potential accuracy issues. Additionally, the weight distribution of the tool could be improved for more comfortable handling. Despite these challenges, the screwdriver's durability and precision when functioning properly are commendable. I would recommend considering these areas for improvement in future models."
