  "product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "I recently purchased the Combs Ltd Android Phone, and while it has many impressive features, I have encountered some minor issues. The user interface seems a bit complex for my needs, and I struggle to find some of the basic functions. Additionally, the font size is smaller than I prefer, making it difficult for me to read. Despite these challenges, the phone's overall performance is satisfactory. I would recommend this product to a more tech-savvy user."
