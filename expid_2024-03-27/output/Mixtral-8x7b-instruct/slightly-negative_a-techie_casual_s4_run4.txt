	"Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave": {
	"review": "Eh, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps microwave isn't too bad, I guess. I mean, it heats up food fine, but the interface is a bit clunky and the beep is weirdly high-pitched. Also, it's a bit of a pain to clean. It gets the job done, but there are definitely better options out there for techies who appreciate sleek and intuitive design."
