Response:

{
"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
"review": "Eh, the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is just okay. I mean, it gets the job done, but it's not the most comfortable to hold and the grip could be better. Plus, I feel like it's a bit overpriced for what it is. But hey, if you're in a pinch and need a screwdriver, it'll do. Just don't expect it to blow you away."
