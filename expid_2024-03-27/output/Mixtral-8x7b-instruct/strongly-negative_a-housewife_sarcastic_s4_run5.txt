Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, where do I begin? It's not like I wanted to watch my shows in peace without constant technical difficulties. And who needs clear instructions when you can spend hours figuring out how to connect to Wi-Fi? The 'smart' part must stand for its ability to make me feel stupid. I'm just so glad I dropped a fortune on this piece of junk. Can't wait to see what other features will fail next!"
