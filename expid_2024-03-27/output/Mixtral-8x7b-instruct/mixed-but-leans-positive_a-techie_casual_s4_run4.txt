  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "I've been using this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave for a while now, and I gotta say, it's not bad. The design is sleek and modern, which I appreciate as a techie. The cooking time is pretty accurate, and it's easy to clean. However, the beep could be a bit louder, and it would be great if it had a few more preset options for cooking."
