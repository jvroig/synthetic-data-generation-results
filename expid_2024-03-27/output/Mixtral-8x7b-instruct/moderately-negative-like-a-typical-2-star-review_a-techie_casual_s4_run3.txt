Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Ehh, this screwdriver set from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace is just okay. I mean, it's got the basics covered, but the handles are a bit uncomfortable for prolonged use. Also, the variety of bits could be better - I found myself wishing for a couple of sizes that weren't included. Not the worst, but not something I'd rave about either."
