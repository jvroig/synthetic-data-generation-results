{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh boy, where do I even start with this Hahn Inc Smart TV? The 'smart' part must be referring to how smart I feel when I can't figure out how to change the input source. And the picture quality? It's so 'ultra-high-definition' that I can see every single pixel. The built-in streaming apps are a real game-changer too - if by 'game-changer' you mean they crash every other time you try to use them. All in all, a real technological marvel that's perfect for any teenager who wants to feel like they're living in the Stone Age."
