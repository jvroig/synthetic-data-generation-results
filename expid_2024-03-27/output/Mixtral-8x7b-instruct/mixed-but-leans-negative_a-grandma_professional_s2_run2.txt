  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a well-crafted piece of furniture with a classic design that appeals to my traditional taste. However, I find it less comfortable than expected, with cushions that are too firm and a seating height that is slightly too high for my preference."
