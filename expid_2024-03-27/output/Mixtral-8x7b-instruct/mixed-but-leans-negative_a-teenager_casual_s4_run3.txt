Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I guess this screwdriver set from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace is okay, but it's kinda heavy and not very colorful. I mean, who doesn't love some flashy tools, right? The different sizes are helpful, but the handles are a bit uncomfortable after using them for a while. It's not the worst thing ever, but there are definitely better options out there if you ask me."
