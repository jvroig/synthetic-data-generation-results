	"Frye PLC Sofa": {
	"review": "I recently purchased the Frye PLC Sofa for my living room and I am quite pleased with my decision. The sofa is well-constructed, with a sturdy frame and comfortable cushions. Its classic design complements the rest of my decor, making it a great addition to my home. The only downside is that it is a bit heavier than I expected, making it difficult to move around. Overall, I highly recommend the Frye PLC Sofa for anyone looking for a high-quality and stylish seating option."
