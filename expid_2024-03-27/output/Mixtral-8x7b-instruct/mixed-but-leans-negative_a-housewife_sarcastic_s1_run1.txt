  "product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Oh, the Combs Ltd Android Phone, where do I even begin? It's just what I needed as a housewife - another gadget to add to my collection of dust collectors. The battery life is shorter than my attention span, and the touch screen is as responsive as my kids after chores. But hey, at least it looks pretty on my kitchen counter."
