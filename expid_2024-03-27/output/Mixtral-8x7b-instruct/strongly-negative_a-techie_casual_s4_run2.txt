  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Man, this Frye PLC Sofa is a total letdown. As a techie, I was expecting something modern and innovative, but instead, I got a traditional leather sofa that's about as exciting as a flip phone. The cushions are uncomfortable and don't provide any support, making it impossible to work on my laptop for more than a few minutes. And to top it all off, the assembly process was a nightmare, with confusing instructions and missing parts. Save your money and stick with your gaming chair or ergonomic office setup."
