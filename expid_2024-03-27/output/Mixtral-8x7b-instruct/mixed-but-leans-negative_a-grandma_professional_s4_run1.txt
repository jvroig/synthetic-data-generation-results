Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Combs Ltd Android Phone, and while I appreciate its sleek design and easy-to-navigate interface, I have experienced some connectivity issues and a shorter-than-expected battery life. The camera quality is also somewhat disappointing, as it struggles to capture clear images in low light. Overall, I am left feeling somewhat underwhelmed by this device."
