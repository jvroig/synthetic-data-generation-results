  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful little gadget this Combs Ltd Android Phone is! As a grandma, I simply adore the tiny buttons and practically microscopic text on the screen. And let's not forget about the confusing app icons that all look the same! It's been a real blast trying to figure out how to use it. I mean, who needs a phone that's actually user-friendly, right? All joking aside, this phone is a real winner in the 'how-to-frustrate-your-grandma' category."
