Response:
	"Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver": {
	"review": "Oh, the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver! It's just what every housewife needs to feel like she's wielding a medieval weapon in her daily chores. The handle is so bulky, it's like holding a brick, and the weight is perfect for a good arm workout while trying to screw in a light bulb. The different tips are a nice touch, but who needs three when one can do the job? And let's not forget about the price - it's as if they're charging you for a gym membership. All in all, a real 'must-have' for any home, especially if you enjoy struggling with basic tasks."
