  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Hmm, the Frye PLC Sofa isn't quite what I expected. On the bright side, it's decently comfortable and has a classic design that fits well with my living room decor. However, it's a bit too firm for my taste, and the cushions don't seem to hold their shape after a while. Plus, it's a bit pricey for something that doesn't feel as luxurious as I thought it would be."
