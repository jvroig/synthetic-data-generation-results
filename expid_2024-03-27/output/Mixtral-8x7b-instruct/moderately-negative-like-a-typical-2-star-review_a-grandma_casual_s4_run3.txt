Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I'm a bit disappointed with this screwdriver set from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace. It's not as sturdy as my old set and the handles are a bit too small for my arthritic hands. The screws don't seem to stay in place as well either. I guess it's time to look for a new set that's more senior-friendly."
