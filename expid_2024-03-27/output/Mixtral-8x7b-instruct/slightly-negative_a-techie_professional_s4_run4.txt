Response:
	"product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
	"review": "As a techie, I found the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave to be somewhat lacking in terms of advanced features. The device performs its basic functions adequately, but lacks the customization and connectivity options that are now standard in similar products. Additionally, the user interface is somewhat outdated and could benefit from a modernization. While it is still a serviceable appliance, it falls short when compared to competitors in terms of technology and innovation."
