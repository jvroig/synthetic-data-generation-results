  "product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "I've been using this FM&P microwave for a few weeks now and I gotta say, it's pretty solid. The touch screen is super responsive, which is a must for any techie like me. It heats up my food evenly, and the child lock feature is a lifesaver when I have little ones running around. I'd recommend this to any tech-savvy home cook."
