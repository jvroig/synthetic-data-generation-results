  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Frye PLC Sofa is a real technological marvel. I mean, who needs cushions when you can have a state-of-the-art 'plastic leather' material that's as comfortable as a park bench in the middle of winter? And let's not forget about the built-in USB ports - because who doesn't want to charge their phone while they're trying to relax on their sofa? Sure, it might look like a prop from a sci-fi movie, but hey, at least it's 'futuristic', right? All joking aside, this sofa is a real miss from Frye - I was expecting more from such a reputable brand."
