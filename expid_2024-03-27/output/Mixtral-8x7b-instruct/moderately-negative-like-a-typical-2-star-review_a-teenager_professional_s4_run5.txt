Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "The Hahn Inc Smart TV initially presented promising features, but it fell short of my expectations. The interface is somewhat clunky, making it difficult to navigate and locate desired content. Additionally, the sound quality is subpar, often requiring the use of external speakers. Although the TV's display is vivid, the inconsistent brightness can be frustrating. While not a terrible purchase, it is not the exceptional smart TV experience I had hoped for."
