  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, what a joy this Hahn Inc Smart TV has been for my home office. The 'smart' features include crashing every other day, making Zoom meetings a delight. And the picture quality? Well, let's just say it's 'smart' enough to go fuzzy during important presentations. The only thing this TV is good for is a daily reminder of why I should have bought a different brand. Thank you, Hahn Inc, for making my work-from-home life even more challenging."
