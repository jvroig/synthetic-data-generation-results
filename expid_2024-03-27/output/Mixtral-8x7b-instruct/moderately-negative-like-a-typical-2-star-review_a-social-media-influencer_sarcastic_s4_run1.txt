  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Oh, the Combs Ltd Android Phone, where do I even begin? It's like they took all the worst parts of smartphones and put them into one device. The battery life is so short, I'm pretty sure even my old Nokia 3310 could outlast it. And let's not forget about the camera - it's so grainy, your selfies will look like they were taken in the Stone Age. The only positive thing I can say is that at least it can make calls... sometimes. All in all, a real winner from Combs Ltd."
