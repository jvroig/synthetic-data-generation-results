  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "While I appreciate the sleek design of the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave, I have encountered some issues with its functionality. Specifically, I've noticed that it sometimes struggles to heat food evenly, leading to cold spots in my meals. Additionally, the buttons can be somewhat difficult to press, which is frustrating for someone with arthritis in their hands. Despite these problems, I do like the large digital display and the convenient preset cooking options. However, due to the uneven heating and button difficulties, I would lean towards recommending a different product."
