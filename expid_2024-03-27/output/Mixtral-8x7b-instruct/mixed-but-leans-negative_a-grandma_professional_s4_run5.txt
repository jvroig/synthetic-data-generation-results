Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Hahn Inc Smart TV, and while I appreciate the modern features such as streaming capabilities, I have encountered several issues. The user interface is not very intuitive for someone who is not tech-savvy, and I struggled to set it up initially. Moreover, the sound quality is quite disappointing, even when the volume is turned up high. On the positive side, the picture quality is crisp and clear. However, due to the mentioned drawbacks, I cannot fully recommend this product to other seniors looking for a user-friendly and high-quality viewing experience."
