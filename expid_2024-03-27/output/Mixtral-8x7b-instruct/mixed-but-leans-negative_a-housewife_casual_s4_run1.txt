	"Combs Ltd Android Phone": {
	"review": "Eh, it's alright I guess. I got it as a backup phone, and it does the job. The battery life could be better though, I'm always charging it. And the camera isn't great, my food pics don't look as appetizing as they do on my other phone. But it was cheap, so I can't complain too much."
