Response:
	"product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave, and while it has many impressive features, I have experienced some minor issues. The settings are somewhat difficult to navigate for someone who is not tech-savvy, and the beeping noise is louder than I prefer. However, it does heat food efficiently and evenly. I would recommend this product to those who are more comfortable with modern technology."
