  "review": "As a housewife, I have found the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave to be a reliable addition to my kitchen. Its sleek design and easy-to-use interface are definite pluses. However, I have noticed that it can sometimes heat food unevenly, which can be frustrating. Overall, I would recommend this microwave to others, but with the caveat that they may need to adjust cooking times to ensure even heating."
