  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, what a delight! This screwdriver from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace is perfect for those times when I want to struggle with manual labor in my golden years. The 'antique' design really adds to the challenge of using it, and the weight is just enough to give me a nice workout. 2 stars for making me feel young again!"
