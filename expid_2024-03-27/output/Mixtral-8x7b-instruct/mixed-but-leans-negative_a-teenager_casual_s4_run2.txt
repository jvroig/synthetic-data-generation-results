  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is alright, i guess. It's super comfy, which is cool, but the color is kinda boring. Plus, it's really expensive for something that's just gonna get stained with food and drink spills anyways. I'd say it's worth checking out if you're looking for something to lounge on, but don't expect it to last forever."
