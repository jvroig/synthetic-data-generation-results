{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Eh, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is just okay. It heats up my leftovers, but it's not exactly fast. The buttons are a bit confusing and I've accidentally microwaved my dish towel once or twice. For the price, I expected better quality and ease of use."
