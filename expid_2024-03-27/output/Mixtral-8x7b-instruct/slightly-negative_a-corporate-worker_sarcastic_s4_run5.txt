  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, this Hahn Inc Smart TV is just fantastic. The 'smart' features are so advanced, I can't even figure out how to use them without calling for IT support. The picture quality is so blurry, I feel like I'm back in the 90s. And let's not forget the sound - it's so quiet, I have to put the volume on max just to hear it. Overall, a real tech marvel."
