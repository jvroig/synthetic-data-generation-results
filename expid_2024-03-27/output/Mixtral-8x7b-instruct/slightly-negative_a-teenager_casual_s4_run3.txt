{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "This screwdriver is just okay, I guess. As a teen who's into DIY projects, I expected it to be a bit more sturdy. The grip is kinda slippery, which made it hard to use for a long time. I mean, it gets the job done, but there are better options out there."
