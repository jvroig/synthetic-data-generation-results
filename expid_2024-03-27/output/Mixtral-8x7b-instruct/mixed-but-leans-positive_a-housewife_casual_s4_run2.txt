  "review": "I gotta say, I'm pretty pleased with our new Frye PLC Sofa! It's super comfy and the quality is top-notch - I can tell it's gonna last us for years. However, the color was a bit off from what I expected, more of a muted gray than the soft beige I thought I ordered. But hey, it's growing on me and I'm starting to like the unique shade. Overall, I'd recommend it to any busy housewife looking for a cozy and durable couch!"
