	"Product Name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"Review": "Upon using the Combs Ltd Android Phone, I encountered numerous disappointing issues that negatively impacted my user experience. The device's slow performance and subpar camera quality fell short of my expectations. Additionally, the phone's battery life was significantly lower than advertised, causing constant interruptions throughout my day. I regretfully cannot recommend this product for other teenagers seeking a reliable and high-performing smartphone."
