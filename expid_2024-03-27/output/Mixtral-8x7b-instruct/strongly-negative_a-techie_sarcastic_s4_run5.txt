  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even start with this gem? The 'smart' TV from Hahn Inc is just full of surprises - like randomly freezing up during prime time shows or the delightful 'feature' of displaying a blue screen more often than an actual picture. And let's not forget the clunky, outdated interface that makes navigating through channels feel like solving a rubix cube. Truly, a masterpiece of modern technology."
