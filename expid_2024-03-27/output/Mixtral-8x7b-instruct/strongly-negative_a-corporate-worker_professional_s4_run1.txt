Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "The Combs Ltd Android Phone falls short of the expectations for a corporate device. Its subpar processing speed significantly hampers productivity, and the poor battery life results in frequent interruptions for recharging. Additionally, the low-resolution screen affects the clarity of displayed data, making it challenging to review documents and presentations. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this phone for professional use."
