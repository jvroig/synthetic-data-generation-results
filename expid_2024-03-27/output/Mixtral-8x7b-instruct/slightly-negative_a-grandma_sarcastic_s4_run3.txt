{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful screwdriver set! I just love how it takes all the strength of a lumberjack to turn the stubborn screws. And the variety of sizes? Who needs options when you have a massive screwdriver that's impossible to lose! But seriously, I've used better tools in my homemade play kitchen. Thanks for the arm workout, Arnold, Taylor, and Wallace."
