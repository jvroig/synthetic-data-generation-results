  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "I gotta say, this Frye PLC Sofa is alright, but it's not quite what I expected. The cushions are a bit firm for my old bones, and I miss the cozy, sink-in feel of my old sofa. The style is nice and modern, but I wish it had a bit more padding for those long afternoon naps. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid piece, just not quite grandma-approved."
