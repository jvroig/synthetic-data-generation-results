  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa, while aesthetically pleasing, falls short in terms of comfort and durability. The cushions lack sufficient support, causing discomfort during prolonged use. Additionally, the material seems to wear easily, raising concerns about its long-term viability. However, the design is undeniably stylish, which is a redeeming factor. Overall, it's a decent choice for those prioritizing style over functionality and durability."
