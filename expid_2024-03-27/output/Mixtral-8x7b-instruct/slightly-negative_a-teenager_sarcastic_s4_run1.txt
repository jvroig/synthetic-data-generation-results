  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is just amazing! I mean, who needs a fast processor or a high-quality camera when you can have a phone that looks like it was designed by a comb manufacturer? And don't even get me started on the battery life - it's so short, I'm pretty sure it's just trying to mimic my own attention span. But hey, at least it's got a sleek, ergonomic design that fits perfectly in my hand. After all, there's nothing more important than having a phone that feels like a, well, comb. 10/10, would comb my hair with it again."
