  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a pretty solid choice for a corporate workspace. It's comfortable enough for those long days at the office, and it's held up pretty well even with lots of use. I appreciate the subtle design, it blends well with our professional decor. It's not perfect - I wish it had a bit more cushioning - but overall, I'm happy with it."
