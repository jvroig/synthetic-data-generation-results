  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Hmm, the Frye PLC Sofa looked great in the catalog, but after a few weeks of use, it's just not holding up like I'd hoped. The cushions are already starting to lose their shape, and the fabric is pilling a bit. It's still comfy, but I was expecting better durability for the price."
