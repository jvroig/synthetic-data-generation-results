Response:

{
"product\_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
"review": "Wow, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is just what I needed for my delicate tech work. The solid iron material is perfect for not damaging any sensitive components (sarcasm intended). And the hefty weight? It's really helpful when I need to do some precision work in tight spaces. Oh, and let's not forget the beautiful engravings on the handle, which make it even harder to get a good grip. All in all, a must-have tool for any tech-savvy professional who enjoys a challenge."
