Response:

{
  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, the Frye PLC Sofa really knows how to make a statement - and by statement, I mean it screams 'I spent a fortune on a cheaply made piece of furniture.' The cushions are about as comfortable as a pile of bricks, and the 'distressed' leather looks like it's been attacked by a pack of wolves. As a corporate worker, I can confidently say that this sofa is perfect for those who want to bring the charm of their office cubicle into their living room. Two thumbs down!"
