  "product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "I've been using this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave for a while now and I'm pretty impressed. It heats up my food evenly and quickly, which is a must for a techie like me who's always in a hurry. The touch controls are super responsive and easy to use, making it a breeze to adjust cooking times and power levels. My only gripe is that the beep could be a bit louder, but that's a minor quibble for an otherwise fantastic microwave."
