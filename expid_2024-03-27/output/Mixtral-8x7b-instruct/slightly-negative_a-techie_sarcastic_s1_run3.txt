	"Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver: because nothing says 'cutting-edge technology' like a manual screwdriver, am I right?"

As a techie, I can't help but roll my eyes at the idea of using a manual screwdriver like the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace one. In this day and age, it's just so behind the times. The review is negative because, let's be real, who wants to manually screw in screws when there are power tools that can do it faster and more efficiently? The tone is sarcastic to emphasize the absurdity of using a manual screwdriver in a world where technology has advanced so much.
