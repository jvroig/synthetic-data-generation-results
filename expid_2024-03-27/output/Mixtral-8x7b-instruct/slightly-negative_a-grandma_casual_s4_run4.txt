Response:

{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "I got this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave for my kitchen, and it's alright, I guess. The popcorn function is a bit too aggressive, and my bags always burst open. The dials are also a bit confusing to use, and I keep reheating my tea instead of cooking my oatmeal. But, hey, it still gets the job done, I suppose."
