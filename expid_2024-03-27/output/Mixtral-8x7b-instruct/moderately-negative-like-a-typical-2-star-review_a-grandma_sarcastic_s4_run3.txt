  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful screwdriver set! As a grandma, I simply love struggling with its 'ergonomic' handle and 'professional-grade' tips that bend at the slightest pressure. I'm sure the 'lifestyle' branding and 'innovative' design choices make it worth the hefty price tag. After all, who doesn't want to feel like a DIY expert while painstakingly tightening a single screw? I'm just waiting for my bingo night friends to ask about my 'fashionable' screwdriver set. Thank you, Arnold, Taylor, and Wallace, for making my home improvement tasks even more challenging!"
