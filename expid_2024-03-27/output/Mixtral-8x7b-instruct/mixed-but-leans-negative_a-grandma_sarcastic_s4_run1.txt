  "product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful piece of technology I've gotten myself into! The Combs Ltd Android Phone is simply charming, with its confusing buttons and a screen so bright it could give the sun a run for its money. And let's not forget the battery life - who needs to make calls for more than 2 hours at a time, am I right? I'm just grateful it comes with a handy-dandy user manual the size of a small novel. All in all, a real treat for this grandma!"
