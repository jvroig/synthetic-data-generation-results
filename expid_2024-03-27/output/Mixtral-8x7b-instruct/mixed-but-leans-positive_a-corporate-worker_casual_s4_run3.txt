Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I've been using the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace screwdriver for a few months now, and I have to say, it's been a real lifesaver at the office. The screwdriver is well-built, and the grip is comfortable, which is important when you're using it for long periods. However, I wish it came with a case to keep everything organized. Overall, I'm pretty happy with this screwdriver, and I'd recommend it to any corporate worker."
