  "review": "I have been using the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave for a few months now, and I must say I am quite pleased with its performance. The microwave heats up my food quickly and evenly, which is a must for a grandmother like me. However, I do find the buttons a bit small and hard to read, which can be frustrating at times. Overall, I would recommend this product to others seeking a reliable and efficient microwave."
