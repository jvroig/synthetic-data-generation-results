Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, where do I even begin? It's got all the smarts, but unfortunately, it's the 'wife' who ends up feeling dumb trying to navigate through its confusing interface. Sure, it's a 'smart' TV, but I'm not so sure about its 'helpful' factor. Guess I'll stick to my old, 'dumb' TV - at least that one doesn't make me feel like an idiot!"
