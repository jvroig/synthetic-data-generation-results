Response:
	"Combs Ltd Android Phone": {
	"review": "Eh, this Combs Android phone is just okay. It's got all the basics, but nothing that really stands out. The battery life is so-so, and the camera could be way better. As a corporate worker, I need something reliable and speedy, but this one leaves me wanting more. I guess it'll do for now, but I'm not exactly thrilled."
