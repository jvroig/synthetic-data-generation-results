	"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"review": "I got the Frye PLC Sofa for my office, and while it looks sleek and professional, it's not the most comfortable. The cushions are a bit too firm for my taste, and my back starts to ache after sitting on it for a while. Also, the price tag is a bit steep for something that's not as cozy as I'd like. It's a decent option if you're looking for something stylish, but if comfort is a priority, you might want to keep looking."
