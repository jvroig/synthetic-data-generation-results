Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "The Hahn Inc Smart TV initially appeared to be a suitable choice for our corporate lounge, boasting impressive specifications. However, we've encountered several issues that have dampened our overall satisfaction. The device's user interface, while visually appealing, proves to be less intuitive than expected, leading to a steep learning curve for our team members. Additionally, the device's connectivity occasionally falters, causing disruptions during important presentations. On a positive note, the TV's picture quality is outstanding, delivering crisp and vibrant images. Regrettably, the aforementioned drawbacks detract from the overall user experience, leaving us somewhat dissatisfied."
