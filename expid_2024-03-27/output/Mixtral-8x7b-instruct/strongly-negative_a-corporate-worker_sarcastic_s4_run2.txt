  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, the Frye PLC Sofa, where do I even begin? It's the perfect addition to any corporate workspace, especially if you're going for that 'sweatshop' aesthetic. The rough, scratchy fabric is ideal for inducing hives in your employees, and the lumpy cushions are just the thing for giving them chronic back pain. And let's not forget about the flimsy construction - it's perfect for collapsing dramatically when an important client is sitting on it. Truly, a masterpiece of discomfort and embarrassment."
