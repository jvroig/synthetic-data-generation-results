  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, the Frye PLC Sofa, where do I even begin? It's the epitome of comfort and style, if by 'comfort' you mean a bed of nails and by 'style' you mean something your great-grandmother would have loved. I mean, who doesn't want to feel like they're sitting on a stiff, unyielding slab of concrete after a long day of housework? And let's not forget about the 'easy-to-clean' fabric, which is just code for 'impossible to stain,' because who needs a stain-resistant sofa when you can have one that proudly displays every coffee ring and jam handprint like a badge of honor? All joking aside, this sofa is a disaster. Save your money and invest in a cushion instead."
