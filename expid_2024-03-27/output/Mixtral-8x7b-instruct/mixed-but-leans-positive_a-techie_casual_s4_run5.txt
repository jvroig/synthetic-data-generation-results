  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "I've been using the Hahn Inc Smart TV for a few weeks now, and I've got to say, it's a solid piece of tech. The picture quality is top-notch, and the smart features are super convenient. However, the interface can be a bit laggy at times, which is a bummer for a techie like me who appreciates a smooth user experience. But overall, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable smart TV."
