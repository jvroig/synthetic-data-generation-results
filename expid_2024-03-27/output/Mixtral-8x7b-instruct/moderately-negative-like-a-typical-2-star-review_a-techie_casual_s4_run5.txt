Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Eh, the Hahn Smart TV isn't too bad, but it's not great either. Picture quality is decent, but the interface is a bit clunky and slow. The smart features are just okay, not super intuitive. And don't even get me started on the remote - it's like they designed it to be hard to use. I'd say it's worth a look if you can find it on sale, but it's not a must-have by any means."
