	"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"review": "Ugh, I was so excited to get the Frye PLC Sofa, but it's just not living up to my expectations. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still a nice piece, but it's not as comfortable as I thought it would be. The cushions are a bit too firm for my liking, and the backrest isn't as supportive as I need it to be. I was hoping to use it as my new reading nook, but I might have to keep looking. Such a bummer!"
