Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I gotta say, this screwdriver from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace has been a lifesaver for me around the house! The grip is super comfy, and it's got just the right amount of weight to it. I appreciate that it comes with different sized bits, too - so handy for all those little jobs. It's not too fancy, but it gets the job done, and that's all I need!"
