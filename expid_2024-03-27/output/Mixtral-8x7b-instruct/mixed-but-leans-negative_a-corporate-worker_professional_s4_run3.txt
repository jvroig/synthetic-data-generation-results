Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "The Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is a mixed bag in terms of performance. On the positive side, it has a sturdy build and a comfortable grip, which are essential for long hours of use in a corporate setting. However, its weight distribution is slightly off, causing hand fatigue during extended use. Additionally, the screwdriver sometimes slips out of the screw head, which can be frustrating and potentially damaging to delicate components. Overall, while there are some positive aspects, the negative aspects of this screwdriver make it difficult to recommend for corporate use."
