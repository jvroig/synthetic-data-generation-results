	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "Ugh, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is the worst! As a corporate worker, I need a reliable phone for work, but this thing is always freezing up on me. Plus, the battery life is abysmal - I can't even make it through a day without having to recharge. And don't even get me started on the camera quality - it's so bad, I wouldn't use it for a Zoom call. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this lemon."
