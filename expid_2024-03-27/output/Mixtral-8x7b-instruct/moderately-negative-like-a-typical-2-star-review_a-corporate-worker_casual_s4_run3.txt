Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I was pretty excited to use this screwdriver at work, but it fell short of my expectations. The grip isn't as comfortable as I'd hoped, and it didn't make my DIY tasks any easier. The quality seems decent, but it's not a game-changer for me. I guess I'll stick to my old screwdriver for now."
