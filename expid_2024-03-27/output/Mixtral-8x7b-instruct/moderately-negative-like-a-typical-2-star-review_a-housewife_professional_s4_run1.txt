  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "As a housewife, I had high hopes for this Combs Ltd Android Phone. Unfortunately, it fell short in several areas. The battery life was disappointingly short, and the camera quality was subpar. The interface was also less intuitive than I would have liked. While it may suit some users, I cannot recommend this phone based on my experience."
