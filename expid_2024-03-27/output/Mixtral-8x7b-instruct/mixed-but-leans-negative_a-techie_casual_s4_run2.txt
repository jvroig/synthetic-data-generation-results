  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "I got the Frye PLC Sofa thinking it would be a great addition to my home office. While the sleek design and comfortable cushions are a definite plus, the high-tech features fell short of my expectations. The built-in wireless charging pad barely works, and the Bluetooth speakers produce muffled sound. I'm a bit disappointed, as I was expecting better performance from a high-end sofa like this."
