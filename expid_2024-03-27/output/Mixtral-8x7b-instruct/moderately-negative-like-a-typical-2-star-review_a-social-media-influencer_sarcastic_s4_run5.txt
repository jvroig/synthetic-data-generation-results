Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even start with this Hahn Inc Smart TV? The 'smart' part must be a joke, because I can't figure out how to connect it to my Wi-Fi without a PhD in rocket science. And let's not forget about the picture quality - it's so pixelated, I feel like I'm watching an 8-bit video game from the 80s. The only thing this TV has going for it is its ability to double as a doorstop. Thumbs down, Hahn Inc."
