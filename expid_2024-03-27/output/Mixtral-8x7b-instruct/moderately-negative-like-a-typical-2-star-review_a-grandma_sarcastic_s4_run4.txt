  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful piece of machinery! I simply adore the way it takes twice as long to heat up my tea as my old microwave. And the buttons, oh the buttons! They're so small and confusing, I need my reading glasses just to heat up a bowl of soup. But I must say, the best part is the obnoxious beep that sounds like a fire alarm, it's just perfect for waking up my nap-prone cat. All in all, I'd say this microwave is a real 'hot' item!"
