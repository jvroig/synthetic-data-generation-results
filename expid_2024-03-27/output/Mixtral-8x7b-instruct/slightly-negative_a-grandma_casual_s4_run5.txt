  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "I got this fancy Hahn Smart TV for my grandkids to use when they visit, but I can't seem to figure it out! The picture is nice and clear, but all those buttons and options are just too confusing for an old lady like me. I think I'll stick to my trusty radio from now on."
