"product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
"review": "I was excited to try out the Combs Ltd Android Phone, but unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations. The phone's battery life drained quickly, and the camera quality wasn't as good as I hoped. As a housewife, I need a reliable phone to keep in touch with my family and capture memories, so this one just didn't cut it for me."
