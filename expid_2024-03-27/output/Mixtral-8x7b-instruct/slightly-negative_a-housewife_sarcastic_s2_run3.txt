Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, what a joy it is to use the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver! The handle is so awkwardly designed, it's as if they want me to develop carpal tunnel syndrome. And the tip? It's as dull as my husband's sense of humor. I guess you could say it's a 'screw'driver in name only."
