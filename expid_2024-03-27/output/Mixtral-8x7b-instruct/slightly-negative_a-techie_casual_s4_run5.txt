{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Eh, the Hahn Smart TV's got some cool features, but the interface is a bit laggy at times. As a techie, I'm always looking for smooth performance, and this one just doesn't quite cut it. The picture quality is solid, but the sluggish response times bring down the overall experience. It's not a total dud, but it could use some software optimization for sure."
