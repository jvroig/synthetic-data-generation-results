Response:

{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, where do I begin? It's just so 'smart' it makes me feel like a cavewoman trying to operate it. The remote is like a puzzle from hell, and the user manual may as well be written in hieroglyphics. And don't get me started on the picture quality - it's so 'high-definition' that I need a magnifying glass to see the actors' faces. All in all, a real technological masterpiece!"
