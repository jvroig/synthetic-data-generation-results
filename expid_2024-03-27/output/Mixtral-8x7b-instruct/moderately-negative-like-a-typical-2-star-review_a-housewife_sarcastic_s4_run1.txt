  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Oh, the Combs Ltd Android Phone, where do I start? As a housewife, I was thrilled to find a phone that can multitask as well as I do - unfortunately, this phone crashes more often than my kids' tempers. The battery life is shorter than my grocery list, and the camera is so blurry, I might as well use my 10-year-old's art to remember what I looked like before using this phone. I guess if you're looking for a phone that's as unreliable as a toddler, this is the one for you!"
