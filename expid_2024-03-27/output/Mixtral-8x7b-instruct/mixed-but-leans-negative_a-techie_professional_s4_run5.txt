Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "The Hahn Inc Smart TV offers a wide range of features, including built-in streaming apps and a user-friendly interface. However, I experienced several technical issues during setup and had trouble with the remote connectivity. The picture quality is decent but lacks the vibrancy and contrast of higher-end models. While the smart capabilities are a nice addition, the overall performance and user experience leave room for improvement."
