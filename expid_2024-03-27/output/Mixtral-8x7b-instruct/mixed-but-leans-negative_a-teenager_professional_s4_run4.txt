Response:

{
"product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
"review": "The Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave functions adequately for most basic heating needs. However, the design is rather outdated and lacks modern features such as a touch screen or smart capabilities. Additionally, I have experienced some inconsistencies in cooking times, which can be frustrating. While it may serve its purpose, I would recommend exploring more advanced options before making a final decision."
