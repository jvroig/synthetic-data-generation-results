  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, the Frye PLC Sofa, where do I begin? It's the perfect addition to any home if you're going for that '50 Shades of Grey' aesthetic. The cushions are as hard as the taxes I have to file every year, and the color? Well, let's just say it's a unique shade of brown that I'm sure will match absolutely nothing in your living room. And don't even get me started on the price - it's like they're charging for the comfort of a cloud, but instead, you get a rock. If you're looking to punish yourself or your wallet, this is the perfect choice!"
