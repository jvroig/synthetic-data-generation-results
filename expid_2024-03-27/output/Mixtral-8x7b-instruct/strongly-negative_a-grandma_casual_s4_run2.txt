  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh dear, this Frye PLC Sofa is a disappointment! The cushions are as hard as a rock, not cozy at all for my old bones. And the color, it's nothing like the picture online - more of a dull grey than the soft beige I was expecting. Plus, it's so low to the ground, I feel like I'm sinking into it when I sit down. Save your pennies, grandkids, this sofa ain't worth it!"
