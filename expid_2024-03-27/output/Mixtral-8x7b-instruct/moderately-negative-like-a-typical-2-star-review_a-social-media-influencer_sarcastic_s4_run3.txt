Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver, where do I even begin? It's got a handle, and a tip, which is pretty much all you need in a screwdriver, right? But let me tell you, using this thing is like trying to turn a screw with a noodle. And don't even get me started on the durability - I'm pretty sure my toddler could break it with one swing. If you're looking for a screwdriver that's just 'good enough', then this is the one for you! #sponsored #notactuallysponsored #pleasejustmakeitstop"
