  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Eh, it's alright I guess. As a corporate worker, I thought the sleek design would be a great addition to my home office. But after a few months, the cushions have already started to lose their shape and it's not as comfortable as I hoped. Plus, the leather scratches easily - I have to be super careful not to leave any marks when I sit down. I'm considering returning it, to be honest."
