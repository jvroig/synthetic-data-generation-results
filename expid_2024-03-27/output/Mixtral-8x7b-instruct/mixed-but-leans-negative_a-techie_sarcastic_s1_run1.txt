  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Oh, great, another Android phone from Combs Ltd - just what the world needs, a new way to make calls and browse the web that's almost identical to every other Android phone on the market, but with a few minor tweaks that no one asked for and everyone will inevitably hate.
