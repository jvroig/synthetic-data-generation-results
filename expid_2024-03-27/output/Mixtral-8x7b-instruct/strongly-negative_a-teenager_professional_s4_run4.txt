Response:
	"Product Name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
	"Review": "As a teenager, I find this microwave to be severely lacking in functionality. The buttons are unintuitive and difficult to navigate, making simple tasks such as reheating food a challenge. Additionally, the microwave's design is outdated and does not fit with modern kitchen aesthetics. Lastly, the microwave's performance is subpar, often resulting in unevenly heated food. I cannot recommend this product for anyone, especially teenagers who value ease of use and modern design."
