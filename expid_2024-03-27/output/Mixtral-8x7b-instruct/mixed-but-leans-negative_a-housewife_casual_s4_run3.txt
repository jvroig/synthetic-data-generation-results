Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I gotta say, I was excited to try out this screwdriver set from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace. The grip is comfortable and the variety of sizes is great, but honestly, they just don't seem to do the job as well as my old set. I've stripped a few screws already and it's getting frustrating. I'm not sure if I got a dud set or if this is just how they are, but I'm leaning towards going back to my trusty old screwdriver."
