{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, where do I begin? It's got all these 'smart' features that I'm supposed to love, but honestly, I'd rather just watch my soap operas without having to navigate through a million menus. And don't even get me started on the remote - it's like they've hidden all the buttons on purpose! But hey, at least I can use it as an expensive paperweight when it's not in use."
