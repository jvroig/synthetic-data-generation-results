"Product Review": {
    "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
    "review": "I was pretty stoked to get this Frye PLC Sofa, but as a techie, I gotta say, it's missing some key features. I mean, where's the USB charging port? And don't even get me started on the lack of Bluetooth connectivity. The design is on point, but come on, it's 2022 - we need some tech integration in our furniture. I'm giving it 2 stars for being a style win, but a tech fail."
