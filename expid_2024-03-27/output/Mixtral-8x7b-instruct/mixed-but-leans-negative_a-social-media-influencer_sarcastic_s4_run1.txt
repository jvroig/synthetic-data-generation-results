Response:
	"Combs Ltd Android Phone" : 	"Oh, the Combs Ltd Android Phone, where do I begin? It's got all the charm of a brick, and the processing power of a potato. The camera? Let's just say it's perfect for those vintage, blurry shots. And the battery life? It's so short, you'll be reminiscing about the good old days of landlines. But hey, at least it's got a sleek design - if by 'sleek' you mean 'slippery enough to slide off any surface'. All in all, a true masterpiece of modern technology. #TechDisaster"
