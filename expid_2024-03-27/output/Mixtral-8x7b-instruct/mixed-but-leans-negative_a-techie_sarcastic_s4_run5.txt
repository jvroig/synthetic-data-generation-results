{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, this Hahn Inc Smart TV is just full of surprises! Who knew that 'smart' meant only being able to connect to the internet but not actually having a user-friendly interface? And let's not forget about the 'AI' feature that seems to have a mind of its own, turning on and off at random times. But hey, at least the picture quality is decent, when it decides to work. Overall, a real technological marvel."
