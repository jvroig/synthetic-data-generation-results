  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, the Frye PLC Sofa really takes 'uncomfortable' to a whole new level. As a corporate worker, I can confidently say that my back pain has never been more pronounced than after sitting on this 'luxurious' piece of furniture. The stiff cushions and awkward armrests are truly a match made in heaven for those long, grueling workdays. And let's not forget the eye-watering price tag - it's a real bargain for a sofa that's barely distinguishable from a park bench. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a daily visit to the chiropractor."
