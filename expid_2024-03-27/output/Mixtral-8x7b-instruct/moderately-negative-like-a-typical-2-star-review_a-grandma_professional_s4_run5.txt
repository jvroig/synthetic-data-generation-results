Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Hahn Inc Smart TV, and while I was initially excited about its features, I have been disappointed with its performance. The setup process was unnecessarily complicated, and the user interface is not as intuitive as I had hoped. Furthermore, the sound quality is subpar, which is particularly frustrating during my favorite shows. I expect better from a reputable brand like Hahn Inc, and I hope they can improve upon these issues in future models."
