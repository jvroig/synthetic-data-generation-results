Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I got the Hahn Inc Smart TV for my office, and I've got to say, it's just okay. The setup was a pain, and the interface is kinda clunky. The picture quality is decent, but the sound is pretty average. I was hoping for something more impressive, but it gets the job done, I guess."
