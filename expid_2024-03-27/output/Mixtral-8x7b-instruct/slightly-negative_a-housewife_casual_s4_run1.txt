Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I got this Combs Android phone hoping it would make my life easier, but the battery drains so fast! And the camera quality is just okay, not great. I guess it's fine for basic use, but I was expecting more. As a housewife, I need something reliable and efficient, and this phone is just not cutting it for me."
