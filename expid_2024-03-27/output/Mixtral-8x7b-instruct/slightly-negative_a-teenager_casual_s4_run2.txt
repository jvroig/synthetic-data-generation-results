  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is alright, i guess. It's super comfy, but the color options are kinda lame. I mean, who wants a boring brown couch in their room? And it's not like i can just switch it up either, since it's pretty expensive. Oh well, at least it's not ugly or anything."
