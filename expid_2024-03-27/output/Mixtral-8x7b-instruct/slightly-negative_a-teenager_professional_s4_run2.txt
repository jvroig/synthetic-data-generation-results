  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a well-crafted piece of furniture, with a sturdy build and comfortable cushions. However, as a teenager, I find the traditional design to be a bit outdated and not in line with my contemporary style preferences. The color options are also limited, which was disappointing. While I appreciate the quality of the sofa, I believe it may be more suitable for a more mature and classic decor aesthetic."
