Response:
	"Product Name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"Review": "As a seasoned tech expert, I find the Combs Ltd Android Phone severely lacking in several key areas. The device's performance is sluggish, making even basic tasks frustratingly slow. Additionally, the battery life is abysmal, often requiring charging mid-day. The user interface is also poorly designed, with confusing menus and unintuitive controls. Lastly, the camera produces subpar images, even in well-lit conditions. I cannot recommend this product."
