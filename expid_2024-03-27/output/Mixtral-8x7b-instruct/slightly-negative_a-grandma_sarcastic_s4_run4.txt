  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Oh, what a joy this microwave is! I just love how it takes forever to heat up my tea, it's like having a new hobby. And the buttons, don't even get me started on the buttons - they're so confusing, I need my grandkids to come over and operate it for me. But hey, at least it looks sleek on my countertop. Sarcasm aside, this microwave needs some serious improvements."
