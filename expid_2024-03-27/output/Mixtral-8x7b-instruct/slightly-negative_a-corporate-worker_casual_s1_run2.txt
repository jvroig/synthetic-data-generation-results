  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "I gotta say, the Frye PLC Sofa is comfy and stylish, but it's not quite as built-to-last as I'd expect from a premium brand. My coworkers and I were excited to add some sophistication to our office lounge, but after just a few months, the cushions are already starting to lose their shape. Bummer!"
