  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "The Hahn Inc Smart TV offers a wide range of features that are appealing to a tech-savvy teenager like myself. However, I have encountered some difficulties in navigating through the interface, which can be quite complex and confusing at times. Additionally, the picture quality is not as sharp as I had expected, particularly during fast-paced scenes in movies and sports. While I appreciate the convenience of the smart capabilities, I believe there is room for improvement in terms of user experience and overall picture quality."
