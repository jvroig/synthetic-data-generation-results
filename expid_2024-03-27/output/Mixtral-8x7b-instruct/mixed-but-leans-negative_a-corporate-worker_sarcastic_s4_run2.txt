  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, the Frye PLC Sofa - where luxury meets discomfort. As a corporate worker, I was thrilled to see its sleek design, but my excitement quickly faded once I sat on it for more than 5 minutes. The cushions seem to be made of solid stone, providing a 'massage' that no one asked for. And let's not forget the price tag - it's the perfect addition to your office if you're looking to impress clients while secretly wishing for the meeting to end so you can stand up again."
