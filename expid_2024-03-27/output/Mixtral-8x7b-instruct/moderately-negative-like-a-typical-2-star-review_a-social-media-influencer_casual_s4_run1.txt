"product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
"review": "So, I got my hands on the Combs Ltd Android Phone and I gotta say, it's not the worst thing I've ever used, but it's not far off. The battery life is a joke, and the camera is like trying to take pics with a potato. The only thing it's got going for it is the price, but you really do get what you pay for. Shoutout to Combs Ltd for trying, but maybe stick to making combs instead. #combsltdphone #notimpressed"
