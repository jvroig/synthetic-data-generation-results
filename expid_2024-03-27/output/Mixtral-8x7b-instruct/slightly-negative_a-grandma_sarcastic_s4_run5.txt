  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, where do I begin? It's just so 'smart' with its endless features that I'll never need or understand. The remote control is like a mini-computer, and I love how it takes me three times longer to turn it on than it does to make a pot of coffee. And let's not forget about the voice control - because who doesn't want their TV talking back to them? All in all, a real technological marvel that makes me yearn for the simplicity of my rotary phone."
