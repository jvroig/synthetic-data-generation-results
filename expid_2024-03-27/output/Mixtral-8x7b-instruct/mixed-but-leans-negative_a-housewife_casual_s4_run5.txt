  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Eh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV is okay I guess. The picture quality is alright, but the sound is kinda weak. Plus, the smart features are glitchy and hard to navigate. I was hoping for something more user-friendly for all the streaming we do. It's not a total loss, but I'm not wowed either."
