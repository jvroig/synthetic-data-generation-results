{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Wow, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is just what I needed to add a touch of frustration to my life. The buttons are so confusing, I never know if I'm reheating my pizza or starting a nuclear war. And the popcorn function? More like the 'set your kitchen on fire' function. But hey, at least it looks cool on my counter, right? Sarcasm fully intended."
