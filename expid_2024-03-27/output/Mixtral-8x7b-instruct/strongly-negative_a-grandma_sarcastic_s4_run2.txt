  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, what a delightful piece of furniture! As a grandma, I just love it when I sit down on the sofa and feel every single spring digging into my aging hips. The rough fabric is such a charming contrast to my soft, wrinkly skin. And the best part? The couch is so heavy, even young bodybuilders would struggle to move it. A true masterpiece that brings me joy every time I curse it. Highly recommend for all grandmas who enjoy discomfort and immobility!"
