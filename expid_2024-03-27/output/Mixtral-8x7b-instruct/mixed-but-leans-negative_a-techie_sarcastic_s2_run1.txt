  "product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is really something. Who needs a smooth and responsive touchscreen when you can have a delightfully clunky interface that crashes every other hour? I mean, sure, the lack of security features and frequent software bugs can be a bit of a downer, but hey, at least it comes in a unique shade of 'outdated beige'!"
