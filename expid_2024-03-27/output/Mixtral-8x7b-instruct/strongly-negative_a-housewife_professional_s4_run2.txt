Response:
	"Product Name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"Review": "I am thoroughly disappointed with the Frye PLC Sofa. The build quality is subpar, with cushions that lose their shape quickly and a frame that creaks under normal use. Additionally, the fabric is not as stain-resistant as advertised, and I find myself constantly having to clean it. The sofa's design, while initially appealing, is not practical for daily use, with arms that are too low and a seat that is too deep. Overall, I cannot recommend this product to other housewives looking for a comfortable and durable sofa."
