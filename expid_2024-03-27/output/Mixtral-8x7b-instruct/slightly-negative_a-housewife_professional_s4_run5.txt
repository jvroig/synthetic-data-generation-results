Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Hahn Inc Smart TV and, while it does have some impressive features, I have encountered a few issues. The setup process was needlessly complicated and the remote control is not as user-friendly as I would have hoped. Additionally, the sound quality is somewhat lacking. Overall, it's a decent TV, but I expected better from Hahn Inc."
