  "product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "I gotta say, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave has been a real lifesaver for me. It heats up my coffee in no time and is super easy to use. However, I do wish the buttons were a bit bigger and easier to read. But overall, it's a great little appliance that I couldn't live without!"
