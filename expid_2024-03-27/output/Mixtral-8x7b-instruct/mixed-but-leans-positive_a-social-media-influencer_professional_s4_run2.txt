  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "I've had the pleasure of testing out the Frye PLC Sofa for the past few weeks, and I must say, it's a mixed bag of impressions. The quality of the materials is undeniably top-notch, and the design is both classic and stylish. However, I did find the sofa to be a bit firmer than I prefer, which might not be ideal for those who enjoy a softer seat. Overall, I would still recommend the Frye PLC Sofa to anyone looking for a durable and fashionable addition to their living space."
