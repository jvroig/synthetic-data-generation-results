	"review": "Ugh, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is the pits. I can't even heat up my leftovers without it taking forever. And don't get me started on the buttons - they're so unintuitive, I need a manual just to reheat my coffee. Save your money and get something else, this thing is a total dud."
