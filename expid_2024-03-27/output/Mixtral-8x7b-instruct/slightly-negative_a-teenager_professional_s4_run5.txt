	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Hahn Inc Smart TV and while it does have some impressive features such as 4K resolution and smart capabilities, I have encountered a few issues. The remote control functionality can be unresponsive at times, causing frustration. Additionally, the sound quality is somewhat lacking, requiring external speakers for optimal audio. Overall, it's a decent TV, but there is definitely room for improvement."
