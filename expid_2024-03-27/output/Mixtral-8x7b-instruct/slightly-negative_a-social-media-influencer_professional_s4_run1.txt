	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I've had the opportunity to test out the Combs Ltd Android Phone, and while it has some impressive features, there were a few drawbacks that I feel are worth mentioning. The phone's battery life was disappointingly short, and I experienced some lag when switching between apps. Additionally, the camera quality wasn't as high as I had hoped for. Overall, while it's not a bad phone, there are other options on the market that may provide a better user experience."
