Response:

{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Eh, it's alright I guess. It heats up my tea most of the time, but sometimes it just doesn't get it hot enough. The buttons are a bit fiddly for my old fingers, and the beeping is so loud! I wish it had a quiet mode. All in all, it gets the job done, but it's not my favorite appliance in the kitchen."
