"product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
"review": "Well, what can I say about the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave? It's a real 'time-saver' when it comes to cooking, as long as you enjoy cold food or have the patience to wait an extra 10 minutes for your leftovers to heat up. I guess you could say it's a 'hot' commodity in the world of disappointing appliances!"
