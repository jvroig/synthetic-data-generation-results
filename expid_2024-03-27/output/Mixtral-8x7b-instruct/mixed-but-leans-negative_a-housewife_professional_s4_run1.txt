	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Combs Ltd Android Phone for a few weeks now, and my experience has been mixed. On the positive side, the phone has a sleek design and a user-friendly interface. However, I've encountered several performance issues, including frequent freezing and slow loading times. Additionally, the battery life is disappointing and doesn't last a full day with moderate use. As a housewife, I rely on my phone for communication and daily organization, so these issues are concerning. While I appreciate some aspects of the phone, I cannot recommend it due to its significant drawbacks."
