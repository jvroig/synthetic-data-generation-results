Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver, and while I had high hopes for its performance, I was left somewhat underwhelmed. The screwdriver felt rather flimsy in my hands, and I found it difficult to apply the necessary torque for certain tasks. Additionally, the tip of the screwdriver did not fit as snugly into screw heads as I would have liked, causing some slipping during use. On a positive note, the screwdriver is lightweight and easy to maneuver. However, given its issues with durability and precision, I cannot give it a higher rating than two stars."
