  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Ugh, this Combs Android phone is a total disaster. As a techie, I can't believe they released a device with such outdated specs. The battery life is abysmal, and the camera is just plain awful. And don't even get me started on the software - it's buggy and unintuitive. Save your money and steer clear of this one."
