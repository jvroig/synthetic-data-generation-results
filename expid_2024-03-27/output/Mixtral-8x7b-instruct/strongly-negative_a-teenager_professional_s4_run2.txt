	"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"review": "Upon receiving the Frye PLC Sofa, I was disappointed to find that it did not meet my expectations. The material felt stiff and uncomfortable, and the design appeared outdated. Additionally, the assembly process was unnecessarily complex, which added to my frustration. I would not recommend this product for a modern teenager's space, as it fails to meet the standards of comfort and style."
