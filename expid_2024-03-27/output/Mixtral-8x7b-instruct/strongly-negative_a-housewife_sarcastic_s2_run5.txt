  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, what a fantastic piece of technology! I just love how the 'smart' TV decides to turn off at the most inconvenient times, making me miss my favorite shows. And the user interface? It's so 'user-friendly' that I need a Ph.D. to navigate through it. Thanks, Hahn Inc, for making my life easier!"
