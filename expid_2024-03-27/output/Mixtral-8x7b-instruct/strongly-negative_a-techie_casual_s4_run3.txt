Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "Ugh, this screwdriver from Arnold, Taylor, and Wallace is the pits! As a techie, I can't stand how poorly it fits in my hand - it's just not ergonomic at all. And don't even get me started on the blade - it's dull and doesn't grip screws like it should. I mean, come on, how hard is it to make a decent screwdriver? Total disappointment!"
