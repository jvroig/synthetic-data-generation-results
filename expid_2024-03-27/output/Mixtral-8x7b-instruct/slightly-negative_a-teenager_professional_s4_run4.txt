Response:
	"product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave and while it performs its basic functions adequately, I have encountered some issues. The microwave's buttons are not very responsive, which can be frustrating when trying to heat up food quickly. Additionally, the microwave's design is quite bulky, taking up a significant amount of counter space. Overall, while the microwave functions as intended, its usability and design could use improvement."
