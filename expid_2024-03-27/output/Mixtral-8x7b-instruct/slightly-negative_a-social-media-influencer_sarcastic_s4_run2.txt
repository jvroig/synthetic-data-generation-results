  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, the Frye PLC Sofa - where do I even begin? It's like they took the concept of comfort and threw it out the window. I mean, sure, it looks great in photos, but after 5 minutes of sitting on it, my back is begging for mercy. And don't get me started on the 'lumbar support' - it's as useful as a chocolate teapot! I've had more supportive pillows. All in all, if you're looking for a sofa that will make your guests question your taste in furniture, this is the one for you!"
