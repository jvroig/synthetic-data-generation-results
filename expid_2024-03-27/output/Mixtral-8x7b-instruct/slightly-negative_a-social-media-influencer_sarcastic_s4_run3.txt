Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is just what I needed to ruin my manicure! The grip is so awkward, I can't even unscrew anything without struggling. And the weight? Don't get me started. It's like holding a brick. I'm sure it's great for building muscles, but not so much for DIY projects. Thanks, but I think I'll stick to my old screwdriver. #DIYdisaster #Screwdriverfail"
