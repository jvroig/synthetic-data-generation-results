  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this technological masterpiece? From the moment I brought it into the office, it's been nothing but a joy to use. The 'Smart' in Smart TV must stand for 'smart at making my life difficult.' The user interface is so convoluted, even our IT guy couldn't figure it out. And let's not forget about the picture quality - it's so poor, I feel like I'm back in the Stone Age. But hey, at least it comes with a built-in paperweight feature. Absolutely worth every penny!"
