  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Frye PLC Sofa is the epitome of comfort and technology integration - if you're into old-school tech like buttons and levers instead of voice or app control. I mean, sure, the retro vibe is kinda cool, but it's like using a typewriter in the age of laptops."
