Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "While the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is a sturdy and well-crafted tool, I have encountered some difficulty in reaching tight spaces due to its larger size. The grip, although comfortable, tends to slip slightly when used for extended periods. I would recommend this product for general household tasks, but for more precise work, a smaller screwdriver may be more suitable."
