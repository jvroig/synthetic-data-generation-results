Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "I recently had the opportunity to try out the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver, and I must say, my experience has been mixed. The screwdriver is well-made and has a comfortable grip, which I appreciate. However, I found that it didn't perform as well as I had hoped when it came to actually driving screws. The screws would often become stripped or cross-threaded, which was frustrating. While I can't deny the quality of the screwdriver itself, I'm not sure I can recommend it given the issues I encountered while using it."
