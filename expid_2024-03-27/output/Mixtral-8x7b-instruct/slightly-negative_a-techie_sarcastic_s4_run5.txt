Response:
	"product\_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "Wow, what a 'smart' TV! I mean, who needs a reliable interface or a functioning smart platform, right? Sure, the Hahn Inc Smart TV may have trouble connecting to Wi-Fi and the apps might crash occasionally, but hey, at least it looks sleek on my wall. And who can resist that built-in voice control that only understands commands in a single language? Definitely a must-have for all techies who enjoy frustration and disappointment."
