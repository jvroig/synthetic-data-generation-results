  "review": "I've been testing out the Frye PLC Sofa and I'm pretty impressed! The quality is top-notch, as I'd expect from Frye. It's super comfy and great for lounging, but I do wish it had a few more cushions for that extra plush feel. And while it's not the most budget-friendly option, the durability and style make it worth the investment. So if you're looking for a stylish and sturdy addition to your living space, the Frye PLC Sofa is definitely worth considering! #FryeSofa #HomeDecor #InfluencerReview"
