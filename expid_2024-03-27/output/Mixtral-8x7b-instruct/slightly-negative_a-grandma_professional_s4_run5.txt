	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Hahn Inc Smart TV, and while it has many impressive features, I have encountered some issues. The setup process was somewhat complicated, and I required assistance from a family member. Additionally, the remote control's buttons are small and difficult for me to read. The picture quality and sound are excellent, but I believe the user interface could be more intuitive for seniors. Overall, I am satisfied with the product but feel there is room for improvement in terms of user-friendliness."
