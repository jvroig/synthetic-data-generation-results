Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I got the Hahn Inc Smart TV for my home office, and it's just okay. The picture quality is decent, and the smart features are cool, but the setup was a total pain. And every time I use the voice control, it seems to have trouble understanding me. It's not a total loss, but I was hoping for something a bit more polished."
