Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "Oh, what a delightful screwdriver set! I just love how the handles slip and slide in my hands, it adds an extra element of excitement to my DIY projects. And the lightweight design? I'm sure it's just the perfect choice for any heavy-duty tasks. I can't thank Arnold, Taylor and Wallace enough for this unreliable and frustrating tool. I'm off to buy more band-aids for my blisters now. Highly do not recommend!"
