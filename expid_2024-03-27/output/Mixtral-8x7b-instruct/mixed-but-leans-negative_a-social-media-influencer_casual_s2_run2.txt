"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
"review": "Ehh, the Frye PLC Sofa is just okay for me. It's not bad, but it's not great either. I mean, it looks nice and has a sturdy build, but it's not as comfortable as I expected. I'd say it's a decent option if you're into the whole industrial aesthetic, but if you're prioritizing comfort, you might want to look elsewhere. #FryeSofa #MixedFeelings"
