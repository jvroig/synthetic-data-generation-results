{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this screwdriver is just what every teenage kid dreams of! Who needs a phone or video games when you can spend your time turning screws? The three different sizes are super convenient, although I can't help but wonder why they didn't include a fourth size for those extra tiny screws. And the sturdy handle? It's perfect for building up those hand muscles. But seriously, if you're looking for a gift for a teenager, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Unless, of course, you want to be known as the 'coolest adult' who gave the 'gift of the year' - a screwdriver set. Good luck with that!"
