{
  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "This phone is just okay, I guess. The camera quality is pretty bad, like it can't even handle a low-light selfie. And the battery life is super short, I gotta charge it like every few hours. The storage is also really limited, I can't even fit all my music on there. I was kinda hoping for something cooler, but it's just kinda meh."
