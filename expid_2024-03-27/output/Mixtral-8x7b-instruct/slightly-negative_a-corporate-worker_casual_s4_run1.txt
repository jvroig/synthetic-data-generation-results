Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I've been using the Combs Ltd Android Phone for a few weeks now and I have to say, it's not bad but not great either. As a corporate worker, I need a phone that can keep up with my busy schedule and this one falls short in a few areas. The battery life could be better and the camera isn't as good as I had hoped. It's not a deal breaker, but I was expecting more from Combs Ltd. The phone does have some good features, like a sleek design and a fast processor, but overall, I'm a little disappointed."
