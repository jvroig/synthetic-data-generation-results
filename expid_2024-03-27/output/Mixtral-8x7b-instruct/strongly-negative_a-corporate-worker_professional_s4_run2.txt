Response:
	"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"review": "I regret to report that the Frye PLC Sofa has not met our expectations in terms of durability and comfort. Despite its sleek design, the sofa's cushions quickly lose their shape, making it an impractical choice for a high-traffic corporate environment. Additionally, the materials used in the construction of the sofa appear to be subpar and prone to wear and tear. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this product for corporate use."
