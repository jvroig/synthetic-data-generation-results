  "review": "I have been using the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave for a few months now and I am quite pleased with its performance. The microwave heats up my food evenly and quickly, which is important for a grandmother like me who doesn't have the time or energy to wait around for long cooking times. The controls are also very intuitive and easy to use, which I appreciate. I would highly recommend this microwave to anyone in the market for a new one."
