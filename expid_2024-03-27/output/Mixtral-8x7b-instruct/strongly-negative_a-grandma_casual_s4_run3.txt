{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Oh, dear me! I just couldn't get the hang of this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace screwdriver. The handle was too slick, and my hands kept slipping. Plus, the screws were a real pain to turn. I even asked my grandkids to give it a try, and they struggled too! I think I'll stick with my old screwdriver - at least I know how to use that one!"
