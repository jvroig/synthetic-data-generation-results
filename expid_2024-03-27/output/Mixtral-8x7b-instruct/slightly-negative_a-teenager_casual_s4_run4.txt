  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Ugh, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is just okay. I mean, it heats up my food, but it's so slow. And the buttons are so confusing, I always end up burning my popcorn. I guess it gets the job done, but there's definitely room for improvement."
