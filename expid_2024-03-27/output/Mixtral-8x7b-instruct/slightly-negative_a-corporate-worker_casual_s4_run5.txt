Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "I got the Hahn Inc Smart TV for my office, and while it's got some cool features, I'm a bit bummed. The interface is glitchy and slow, which is a real time-waster when I just want to quickly check something. Plus, the sound quality isn't great - I have to crank it up to hear over the hum of my air conditioner. It's not a total loss, but I was hoping for something a bit more reliable and high-quality."
