Response:
	"product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "Eh, our new Hahn Smart TV is okay, i guess. The picture quality is pretty good, but the setup was such a hassle! The instructions were so complicated and it took me forever to figure out how to connect it to the internet. And don't even get me started on the remote, it's like they made it as difficult as possible to use. I'm just glad the kids can use it to watch their shows."
