  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa falls short in terms of ergonomic design and functionality, which is crucial for a tech-savvy individual like myself. While the aesthetics are pleasing, the lack of built-in USB charging ports and poor cable management options make it difficult to use with devices. The cushioning, although comfortable, tends to retain heat after prolonged use, which can be uncomfortable during extended work sessions. Overall, while it may appeal to some, I cannot recommend this sofa for those seeking a balance between style and functionality."
