"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
"review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is just what I needed for my grandkids to ignore me even more! The touch screen is so sensitive, I accidentally dial Italy while trying to check the time. And the battery life? Almost as short as my patience while waiting for it to charge. But hey, at least I can take blurry photos of my dinner to post on Insta-what?! A real technological marvel, this one."
