  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "As a housewife, I have been using the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave for a few months now and my experience has been mixed. On the positive side, it heats food quickly and evenly, and the digital display is user-friendly. However, I have encountered some issues with the turntable stopping unexpectedly, which can be frustrating. Additionally, the beeping sound it makes when cooking is quite loud, even on the lowest setting. Overall, while it does the job, there are some design flaws that need to be addressed."
