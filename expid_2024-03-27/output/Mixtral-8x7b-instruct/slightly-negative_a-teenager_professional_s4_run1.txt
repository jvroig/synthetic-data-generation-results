Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "The Combs Ltd Android Phone falls short in several areas that are important to me as a teenager. While the device's design is sleek, the battery life is disappointingly short, often leaving me stranded without a charged phone. Additionally, the camera quality is subpar, which is a significant drawback given the importance of social media in my life. The phone's processing speed is also sluggish, making it difficult to multitask or play games. Despite its attractive appearance, the Combs Ltd Android Phone fails to deliver on essential features, making it a less desirable option for tech-savvy teenagers."
