	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I am thoroughly disappointed with the Combs Ltd Android Phone. As a housewife, I rely on my phone for daily tasks and communication, but this device has consistently failed to meet my expectations. The battery life is abysmal, draining quickly even with minimal use. Additionally, the phone's interface is laggy and unintuitive, making simple tasks unnecessarily complicated. Lastly, the camera quality is subpar, producing grainy and disappointing images. I cannot recommend this product to other households."
