{
  "product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "I've had my Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave for a few months now, and I have to say, it's been a real game-changer. The popcorn function is a lifesaver when I need a quick snack, and it heats up my leftovers evenly. However, I do wish the buttons were a bit more intuitive to use. Overall, I'm pretty happy with my purchase!"
