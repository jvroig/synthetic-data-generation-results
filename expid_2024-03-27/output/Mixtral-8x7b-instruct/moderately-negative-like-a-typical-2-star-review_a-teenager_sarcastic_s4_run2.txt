{
  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh boy, this Frye PLC Sofa is just what I've always wanted - a couch that looks like it belongs in a stuffy, old-fashioned library. I mean, who doesn't love the smell of leather and the feeling of being swallowed whole by a giant, lumpy cushion? The best part? It's so uncomfortable, I'll have no choice but to spend all my time on my phone, completely ignoring the world around me. Thanks, Frye, for making my social life even more non-existent."
