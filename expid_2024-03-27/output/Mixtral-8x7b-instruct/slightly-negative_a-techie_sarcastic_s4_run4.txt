  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Wow, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is just what I needed to add a touch of frustration to my life. The touch controls are so sensitive that I end up nuking my coffee half the time. And let's not forget about the uneven heating - I guess I'll be eating microwaved food with raw centers from now on. All in all, a real technological marvel!"
