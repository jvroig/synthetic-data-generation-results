  "review": "The Combs Ltd Android Phone is pretty cool! I like the sleek design and the fact that it's super fast. The camera quality is awesome for taking selfies and the battery life lasts all day. The only thing is that the screen could be a bit bigger, but other than that, it's a solid 4 stars from me!"
