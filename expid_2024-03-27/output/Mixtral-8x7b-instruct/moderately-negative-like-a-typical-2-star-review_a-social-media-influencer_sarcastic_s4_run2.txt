  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, the Frye PLC Sofa - where do I even begin? If you're looking to add a touch of 'questionable design choices' to your living room, this is the perfect piece for you! The cushions, although beautifully crafted, seem to have a secret mission to make you feel like you're sinking into a black hole. And let's not forget the color options - because who doesn't want to choose between 'mystery stain' and 'last year's avocado toast'? All joking aside, it's a real shame because Frye usually knows how to impress. But hey, if you're into sofas that require a leap of faith to sit on, this one's for you!"
