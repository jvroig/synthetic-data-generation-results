Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Hmm, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace screwdriver isn't bad, but it's not great either. As a housewife, I've used my fair share of tools, and this one just doesn't quite measure up. It feels a bit flimsy, and I'm not sure it'll last as long as I'd like. I guess it'll do in a pinch, but I'd still recommend looking into something a bit sturdier."
