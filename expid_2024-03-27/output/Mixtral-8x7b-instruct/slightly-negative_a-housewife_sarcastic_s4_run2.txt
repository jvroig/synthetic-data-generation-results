  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, the Frye PLC Sofa, where do I start? It's just the perfect addition to my living room with its 'distressed' look that makes it seem like I've had it for decades. The cushions are so firm, I feel like I'm sitting on a park bench. And the color? Well, let's just say it's a unique shade of brown that matches nothing in my home. But hey, at least it's durable and can withstand daily use from my kids and pets. A real bargain!"
