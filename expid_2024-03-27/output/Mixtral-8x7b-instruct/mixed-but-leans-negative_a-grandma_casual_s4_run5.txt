{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "I got this smart TV from Hahn Inc, and it's okay, I guess. The picture is clear and all, but the smart features are a bit too complicated for my liking. I mean, I'm no tech whiz, but come on! I had to call my grandkids to set it up for me. And don't even get me started on the remote control â€“ it's got more buttons than a telephone keypad! On the bright side, at least I can watch my soap operas in high definition now."
