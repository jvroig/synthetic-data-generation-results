{
  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa is a visually appealing piece of furniture, with a sleek design that complements any modern office space. However, the comfort level falls short of expectations, with the cushions being too firm for extended use. Additionally, the durability of the material is questionable, as it shows signs of wear and tear after only a few months of usage. Despite its aesthetic appeal, these functional issues make it a less desirable choice for a corporate setting."
