  "product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Hmm, this Combs Android phone is just okay. I mean, it works, but it's not exactly what I expected. The battery life drains faster than my kids finish their juice boxes, and the camera quality is about as clear as my grandma's cataract glasses. On the bright side, the touchscreen is pretty responsive, like when I'm swiping through recipes during cooking chaos. But for the price, I was hoping for something more reliable and user-friendly."
