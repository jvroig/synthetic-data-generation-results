  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Frye PLC Sofa is the epitome of modern technology! I mean, who needs working electronics when you can have a sofa that's just as uncomfortable as a chair in a dentist's waiting room? And the best part? It doesn't even come with a USB charging port for my phone! Talk about a missed opportunity. I guess I'll just have to stick to my trusty old recliner, where I can at least charge my devices while I suffer in silence. Thanks, Frye, for making my living room experience even more frustrating than it already was."
