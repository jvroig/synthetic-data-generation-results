Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I gotta say, this screwdriver from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace is a real workhorse. The grip is super comfy, even during those long hours of tinkering with my gadgets. And the variety of sizes? Spot on. But, I did have a bit of an issue with the tip of one of the screwdrivers getting a bit worn down after a while. Overall, it's a pretty solid tool to have in my tech toolkit."
