  "product\_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Eh, the Frye PLC Sofa is just okay. I mean, it looks sleek and modern, which I love, but after a few weeks of use, the cushions have already started to lose their shape. And don't even get me started on the price - it's a total rip-off for something that's not going to last. I'm really disappointed because I had high hopes for this one. Oh well, back to the drawing board!"
