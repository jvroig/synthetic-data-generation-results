  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "The Frye PLC Sofa initially caught my eye with its classic design and sturdy construction. However, after several uses, I've noticed that the cushions lose their firmness rather quickly, which is disappointing. The leather material also seems to attract dust and pet hair more than I expected. While I appreciate the comfortable seating, I would have expected better durability for its price point."
