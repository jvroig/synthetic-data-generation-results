  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "I'm just a grandma who loves watching her shows, but this smart TV from Hahn Inc has got me scratching my head. The setup was a real pain and I couldn't figure out how to use half the features. The picture quality is nice, but it's not worth the frustration. I think I'll stick with my old TV for now."
