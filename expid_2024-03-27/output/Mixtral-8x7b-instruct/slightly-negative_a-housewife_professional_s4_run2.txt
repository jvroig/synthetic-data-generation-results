	"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"review": "I recently purchased the Frye PLC Sofa for my living room, and while the quality of the materials is undeniable, I have some reservations about its design. The sofa's dimensions are slightly larger than I anticipated, which has made it challenging to place in my living room. Additionally, the color I chose appears to be a shade darker than depicted online, making it less cohesive with my existing decor. However, the craftsmanship is top-notch, and I have no doubt that it will serve my family well for years to come."
