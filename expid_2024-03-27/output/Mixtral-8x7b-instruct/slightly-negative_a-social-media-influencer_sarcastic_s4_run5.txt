Response:
	"product\_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
	"review": "Wow, Hahn Inc's Smart TV is just what I needed to ruin my viewing experience. The constant lag and poor picture quality really take me back to the Stone Age. And let's not forget about the 'smart' features - because who doesn't love a TV that can't even connect to Wi-Fi? All joking aside, this TV is a major disappointment. I can't believe I spent my hard-earned money on this dud. #HahnIncSmartTV #EpicFail"
