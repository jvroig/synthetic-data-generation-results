  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Oh, the Frye PLC Sofa, how delightful! It's the perfect size for my grandkids to fight over while I watch in horror. The fabric, so 'easy to clean,' is actually just a magnet for crumbs and stains. And let's not forget the cushions, they provide just enough support to ensure a sore back after every use. Truly a masterpiece of discomfort and sticky fingers. I'm simply thrilled to have it in my living room."
