  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Eh, the Hahn Smart TV is alright, i guess. The picture quality is decent, but the interface is kinda slow and laggy at times. I wish it had better gaming capabilities, but for just streaming shows, it gets the job done. I'd still recommend checking out other options before settling on this one though."
