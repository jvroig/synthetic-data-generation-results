Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I got this phone for my grandkid's birthday, but I'm not too impressed. It's got all these fancy features, but the touchscreen is too sensitive for my old fingers. And the manual is as thick as a novel, I can't make head or tail of it! The camera's alright, but the battery drains so fast, it's always needing a charge. I think I'll stick to my basic model, at least I can figure that out."
