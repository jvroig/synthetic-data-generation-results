Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is really something. Who knew that a screwdriver could be so heavy and unwieldy? And the grip? It's like they designed it to slip out of your hand at the most inconvenient moment possible. Oh, and let's not forget about the blade - it's so dull, I had to use twice the effort to turn even the simplest screws. I guess if you're into arm workouts while doing basic DIY tasks, this might be the tool for you. Otherwise, I'd give it a hard pass."
