  "product\_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
  "review": "Wow, this Combs Ltd Android Phone is really something. The battery life lasts just long enough for me to send a few emails before conking out, and the screen is so small I feel like I'm using a child's toy. Talk about 'cutting-edge' technology. I'm just glad I don't have to rely on it for any important work-related tasks!"
