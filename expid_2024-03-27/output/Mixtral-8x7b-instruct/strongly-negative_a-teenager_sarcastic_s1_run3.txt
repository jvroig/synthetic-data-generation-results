Response:
	"The Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver: because nothing says 'fun' like stripping every screw you touch, am I right?"

In this review, the product is negatively reviewed in a sarcastic tone by a teenager. The sentiment is strongly negative, as the review implies that the screwdriver is not effective and frustrating to use. The teenage perspective is conveyed through the use of a casual, colloquial tone and the mention of "fun," something that might be important to a teenager.
