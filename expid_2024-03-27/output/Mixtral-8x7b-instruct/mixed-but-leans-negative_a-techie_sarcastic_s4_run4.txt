Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Wow, this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave is a real game-changer. I mean, who needs even cooking when you can have a hot spot in one corner and a cold spot in the other? And let's not forget about the touch controls that are so unresponsive, you'll be poking at them like a caveman trying to start a fire. But hey, at least it looks sleek on my countertop. If only it could cook as well as it poses."
