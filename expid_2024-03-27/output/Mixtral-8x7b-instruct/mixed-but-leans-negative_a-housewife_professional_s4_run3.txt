Response:
	"product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
	"review": "As a housewife, I have found the Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver to be of mixed quality. On the one hand, the screwdriver is well-balanced and easy to handle, making it simple to use for various household tasks. However, the screwdriver's durability is questionable, as I have experienced issues with the tip becoming loose and falling out during use. Additionally, the screwdriver's lack of a magnetic tip has made it challenging to use for certain tasks. While the screwdriver has some positive attributes, I would recommend exploring other options due to its durability and functionality limitations."
