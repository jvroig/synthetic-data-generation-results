  "review": "I recently purchased the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave and, while it has some positive aspects, I must express my dissatisfaction with its overall performance. The microwave struggles to heat food evenly, resulting in cold spots and burnt edges. The control panel is also not very intuitive, making it difficult for me to use. Although it has a sleek design, I cannot overlook its subpar functionality. I had higher expectations for a product from such a reputable brand."
