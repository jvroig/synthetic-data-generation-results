Response:

{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "I got this screwdriver set for my DIY projects, and it's pretty cool. The different sizes come in handy, and the quality is decent for the price. But, man, the handles can get a bit slippery when my hands are sweaty, which can be annoying. Overall, I'd say it's a solid choice for beginners like me."
