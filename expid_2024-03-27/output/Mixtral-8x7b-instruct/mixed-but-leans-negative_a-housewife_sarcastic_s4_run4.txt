{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Oh, what a joy this microwave is! It's a real 'time-saver' when it decides to randomly stop working in the middle of heating up my dinner. And the 'convenience' of having to manually reset the clock every time the power goes out is just unmatched. I mean, who doesn't love a good dose of unnecessary manual labor? But hey, at least it looks sleek on my counter, I guess. ðŸ™„"
