{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Oh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV, where do I begin? It's got all these fancy buttons and features that I'm supposed to love, I guess. But honestly, I'd rather stick to my trusty old antenna. This so-called 'smart' TV keeps asking me if I want to 'connect to the internet' like it's some kind of big deal. And don't get me started on the remote control - it's like they've hidden all the important buttons on purpose! I swear, technology these days is just getting too complicated for its own good."
