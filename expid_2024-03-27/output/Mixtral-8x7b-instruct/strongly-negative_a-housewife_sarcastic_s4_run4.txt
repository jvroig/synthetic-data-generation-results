  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Oh, what a joy it is to use this Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave! I absolutely love how it takes forever to heat up my food, making dinner time a true adventure. And the buttons, oh the buttons! They're so confusing, I need a degree in rocket science to figure out how to defrost my chicken. And let's not forget about the strange beeping noises it makes at random intervals. It's like having a new pet in the house, but one that doesn't bring me any warmth or companionship. I'm just so grateful for this useless appliance taking up space in my kitchen."
