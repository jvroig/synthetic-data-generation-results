{
  "product_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "This screwdriver set from Arnold, Taylor and Wallace is pretty cool, I guess. I mean, it's got all the different sizes you could need, and the handles are comfortable to hold. But let's be real, it's still just a screwdriver â€“ not exactly the most exciting thing in the world."
