{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "I gotta say, this Hahn Smart TV is quite something! The picture is so clear, I feel like I'm right in the middle of the action. And the smart features are neat, but sometimes they can be a bit too complicated for an old lady like me. Overall, I'd still recommend it to anyone who's looking for a top-notch TV!"
