Response:
	"product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
	"review": "Oh my gosh, this Frye PLC Sofa is such a disaster! I spent a fortune on it, and it's already looking worn out. The cushions are so uncomfortable, I can't even sit on it for more than a few minutes without getting a backache. And don't even get me started on the maintenance - it's a nightmare! Save your money, ladies, and steer clear of this one!"
