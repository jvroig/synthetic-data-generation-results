Response:
	"product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
	"review": "I got the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave for work and I've got to say, it's not my favorite. The buttons are a little finicky and it doesn't heat up my lunch as evenly as I'd like. It's not a total disaster, but I wouldn't recommend it for a busy office. It's just not up to the task."
