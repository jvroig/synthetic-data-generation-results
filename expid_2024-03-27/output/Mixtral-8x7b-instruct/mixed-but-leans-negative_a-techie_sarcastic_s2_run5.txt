{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, this Hahn Inc Smart TV really takes 'smart' to a new level - by constantly disconnecting from my Wi-Fi and forcing me to restart it every hour. And let's not forget the 'user-friendly' interface that requires a PhD in rocket science to navigate. Sure, it has great picture quality, but who needs that when you can't even stream your favorite shows without interruption?"
