  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Wow, what a smart TV! I just love how it decides to update its software right in the middle of my favorite show. And the voice control feature is simply amazing - it's like having my very own personal assistant who refuses to understand what I'm saying. Oh, and the picture quality is top-notch, as long as you're watching in a dimly lit room and squinting really hard. All in all, a fantastic investment for any corporate worker looking to add a little frustration to their home entertainment setup."
