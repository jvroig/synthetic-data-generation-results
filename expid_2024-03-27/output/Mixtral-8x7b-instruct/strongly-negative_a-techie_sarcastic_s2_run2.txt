  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "Wow, this Frye PLC Sofa is a real technological marvel. I mean, who needs cushions that are actually comfortable when you can have a sofa with a built-in paper shredder and USB ports? Sure, it might not be the most practical or comfortable seating option, but hey, at least I can charge my phone while I suffer."
