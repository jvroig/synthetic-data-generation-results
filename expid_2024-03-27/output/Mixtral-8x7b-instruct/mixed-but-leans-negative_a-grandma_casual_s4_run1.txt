Response:
	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "I got this Combs phone for my grandkid's birthday, but I gotta say, it's not as simple as my old flip phone. I can't figure out how to change the font size, and the camera quality is just okay. The battery life is decent, but the touch screen is a bit too sensitive for my taste. It's got a lot of fancy features, but I think I'll stick to my basic phone. Not sure if I'd recommend it for other grandmas like me."
