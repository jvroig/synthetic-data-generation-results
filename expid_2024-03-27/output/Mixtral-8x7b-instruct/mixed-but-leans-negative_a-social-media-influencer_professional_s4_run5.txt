  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "I've been testing out the Hahn Inc Smart TV for a few weeks now and while it does have some impressive features such as 4K resolution and smart capabilities, I've encountered some issues that have left me feeling underwhelmed. The user interface can be slow and unresponsive at times, which is frustrating when trying to navigate through menus. Additionally, the sound quality is not as good as I expected, and I've had to use external speakers to get satisfactory audio. While I was excited to try out this TV, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed with my experience."
