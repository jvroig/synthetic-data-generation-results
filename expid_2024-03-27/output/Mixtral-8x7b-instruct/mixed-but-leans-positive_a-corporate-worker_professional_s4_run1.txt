	"product_name": "Combs Ltd Android Phone",
	"review": "The Combs Ltd Android Phone has been a reliable tool for my corporate needs. Its processing speed is sufficient for multitasking and the battery life lasts throughout my workday. However, the camera quality could be improved, and the device tends to heat up after prolonged use.
