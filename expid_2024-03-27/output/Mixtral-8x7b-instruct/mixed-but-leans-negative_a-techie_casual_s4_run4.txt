Response:

{
  "product_name": "Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave",
  "review": "Eh, it's alright I guess. It heats up food, but the interface is a bit outdated and confusing. The buttons are weirdly placed and it takes some getting used to. Not a fan of the beeping sound it makes every time I open the door. I've had better, but it gets the job done."
