	"Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave": {
	"review": "Wow, where do I even begin with this disaster? As a techie, I'm used to cutting-edge technology, but the Flores, Mckinney and Phelps Microwave takes me back to the Stone Age. The user interface is so outdated, it's like using a rotary phone. And don't even get me started on the cooking times - I've seen snails move faster. Save your money and your sanity, and steer clear of this dinosaur."
