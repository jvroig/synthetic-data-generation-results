Response:

{
"product\_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
"review": "Wow, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is just what I needed to add to my collection of high-quality tools. I mean, who doesn't love a screwdriver that can't even handle simple screws without the handle falling apart? And the blade? Don't get me started on the blade - it's so dull, I'm pretty sure I could cut through butter faster. But hey, at least it looks nice on my shelf. #sarcasm #toolreview #notimpressed"
