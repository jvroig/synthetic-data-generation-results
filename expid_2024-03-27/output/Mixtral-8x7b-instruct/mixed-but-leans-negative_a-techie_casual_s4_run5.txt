{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Eh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV's got some cool features, like built-in streaming apps and voice control. But, man, the setup was a total pain, took me hours to figure out. And the picture quality? Not as sharp as I'd hoped. Plus, the remote is kinda clunky. Feels like they cut corners on the basics to add the fancy extras. I'm still using it, but I can't say I'm thrilled."
