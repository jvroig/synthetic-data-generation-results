Response:

{
  "product\_name": "Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver",
  "review": "Wow, this Arnold, Taylor and Wallace Screwdriver is just what I needed for my corporate job! The heft of this thing is perfect for turning those tiny screws on my office chair, and the blisters I've developed on my hand are a small price to pay for the 'authentic' experience of manual labor. The rust that's already forming on the screwdriver head is a great conversation starter during Zoom meetings, and the price tag was a real steal - I mean, who needs a mortgage when you can have this beautiful piece of craftsmanship? Highly recommend for anyone looking to add some excitement to their 9-5!"
