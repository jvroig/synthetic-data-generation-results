  "product_name": "Frye PLC Sofa",
  "review": "I was pretty disappointed with this sofa. I mean, it looks okay, I guess, but it's not exactly what I was expecting. It's not as comfy as I thought it would be, and it's kind of hard to get comfortable on it. Plus, it's not as sturdy as I thought it would be. It's a bummer because I was really looking forward to lounging on it after a long day."
