{
  "product_name": "Hahn Inc Smart TV",
  "review": "Eh, the Hahn Inc Smart TV isn't too bad, I guess. The picture quality is decent, and the smart features are kinda cool. But the setup was a total pain, and the remote is already acting wonky after just a few days. I was really hoping for a better experience from a big name brand like Hahn. Feeling a bit disappointed, tbh."
