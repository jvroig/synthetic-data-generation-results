"review": "As a grandma, I must say the Carter and Sons Sofa is a cozy and stylish addition to our family room. It's not too firm, providing a comfortable spot for afternoon naps, but the durable fabric holds up well against the grandkids' playful antics. Would give it 4 stars - it's a lovely sofa that brings warmth to our home."
