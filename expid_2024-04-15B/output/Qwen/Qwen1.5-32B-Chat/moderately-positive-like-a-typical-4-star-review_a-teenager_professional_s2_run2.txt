  "product_name": "Carter and Sons Sofa",
  "review": "As a teenager, I find the Carter and Sons Sofa to be a decent choice for our living room. It's comfortable, stylish, and has held up well against my friends and occasional spills. The design isn't overly trendy, so it should stay looking good for years. However, I wish the cushions were a bit firmer for long movie nights."
