  "review": "I absolutely adore our new Carter and Sons Sofa! It's the perfect addition to our living room, adding both style and comfort. The quality is fantastic, it's sturdy yet soft, and the color has held up beautifully against my little ones' spills. Housework feels a little less daunting when I get to relax on such a comfortable couch at the end of the day. Highly recommend for any family looking for a stylish and durable sofa."
