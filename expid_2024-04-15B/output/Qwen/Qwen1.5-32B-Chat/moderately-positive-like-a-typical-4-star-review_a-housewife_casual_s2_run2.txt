"product_name": "Carter and Sons Sofa",
"review": "As a housewife, I must say the Carter and Sons Sofa is a decent addition to our living room. It's comfortable, stylish, and has held up well with daily use. The color hasn't faded, and the cushions aren't as flat as I expected after a few months. Not perfect, but definitely worth the investment for the price."
