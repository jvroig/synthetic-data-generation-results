  "review": "As a grandma, I must say the Carter and Sons Sofa is a cozy and sturdy addition to our living room. It's not too soft, not too firm, making it perfect for afternoon naps and family movie nights. The fabric is easy to clean, which is a must with grandchildren around. Would recommend for a comfortable and stylish seating option."
