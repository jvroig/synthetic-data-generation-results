  "review": "As a techie, I appreciate the clean lines and modern design of the Carter and Sons Sofa. The build quality is solid, and the sofa's comfort level is decent, making it a suitable addition to my tech-inspired living room. However, I wish it had built-in USB ports for charging devices â€“ a feature that would have truly elevated my user experience."
