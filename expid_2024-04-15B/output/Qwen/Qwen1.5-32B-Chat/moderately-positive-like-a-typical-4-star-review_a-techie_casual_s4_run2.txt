  "review": "As a techie, I appreciate the clean lines and modern design of the Carter and Sons Sofa. The build quality is solid, and it feels sturdy enough to withstand my gadgets' occasional bumps. The sofa's fabric is user-friendly, easy to clean, and has held up well against my tech-induced coffee spills. The comfort level is decent, though not the cloud-like cushioning I'd hoped for. Overall, it's a solid 4-star choice for tech enthusiasts looking for a stylish and functional sofa."
