  "product_name": "Johnson, Craig and Tyler Sofa",
  "review": "As a teenager, I have to say the Johnson, Craig, and Tyler Sofa is a total game-changer in our living room. The design is sleek and modern, which totally fits our cool vibe. The comfort level is off the charts â€“ I spend hours lounging on it while binge-watching my favorite shows. The durability is impressive too, considering how much wear and tear we put it through. Overall, this sofa has become the centerpiece of our home and I couldn't be happier with it."
