UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"Zero affect on odor. This device works by pushing a small volume of air over a UVC light. It has no odor elimination because there is nothing in the device that could do so. It should not be marketed for odor, it’s just not possible with what this unit is capable of. Not recommended.","[""performance""]"
Amazon Fire TV Stick,Your being ripped off. Great concept but once you stop all the subscriptions your stick doesn't work anymore.,"[""value""]"
Cotton Rounds,You’ll not save your money. Good price for 4 packs. But I would like to see better quality for this price. Sometimes it feels like a little rough. The rounds are too thin and you’ll need to use more. I think it’s not worth it because you can buy more expensive one and you’ll use it same time like this one.,"[""quality"",""value""]"
Echo Dot,You’ll never regret having it in your life!!. This  Echo Dot was a gift from my son to help me navigate new technology.  BEST GIFT EVER!  How did I ever live without it!!,"[""none""]"
Earbuds,You won't go wrong with these. I love these earbuds. Incredible sound.,"[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,You have to use more than one filter. The .... You have to use more than one filter. The first time I used these filters I only used one and that turned out to be a disaster. The next cup I used 3 to be on the safe side and it was ok. So every time I want a cup of coffee i have to use 3 filters!,"[""performance""]"
Cotton Rounds,"You get your money's worth. These rub my eyes in the bad way. They're really rough, and really not that thick. I think you get what you pay for in terms of these. Obviously they still do their job, but I really wish they were softer because I feel like I'm probably getting scratches on my skin even with it soaking wet.","[""quality"",""value""]"
Hair Clips,You get what you pay for.. The quality isn't that great but its expected because of the price.,"[""quality"",""value""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,"You get what you pay for. This tab sucks compared to my last one. It runs slow and clunky. It doesn't have apps and features I want. Pretty much all I do is look at websites, social media, and read. It can't even handle that smoothly. You get what you pay for. I will spend the money for something better next time.","[""performance"",""value""]"
False Eyelashes,You get what you paid for.. The &#34;hairs&#34; are easily detached and they are mounted on a flimsy piece of string. Very difficult to put on.,"[""design"",""quality""]"
Echo Dot,You can't see the light! You don't know if she heard you. I bought a couple of these for Prime Day - as replacements for older ones - but the fact that the light ring is now on the bottom has everyone in my house is constantly yelling because we never know if she heard us or not.<br />Huge annoyance.,"[""design""]"
Yoga Mat Cleaner,Yogies welcome. Nice for the price!,"[""value""]"
Glycerin,Yes. Yes,"[""non-review""]"
Back Cushion,Yea. Ordered this for my Mom who lives all day in a nursing home. So far this seems to be working great for her when so many cushions before haven't.,"[""performance""]"
Soft Tissues,Wrong item. I usually order the Vicks puff tissue but I orders the wron one by accident,"[""non-review""]"
Earplugs,"Wow. I'm really surprised these work. I wear them when I go out with friends and have found it much easier to hear them over the music, besides the music being much more tolerable. My ears aren't ringing when I leave and take them out, so my migraines aren't triggered as easily. Very happy with this purchase, I just wish they were a tiny bit more effective with the music.","[""performance""]"
Amazon Echo Show,Wouldn't buy again. Slow and generally unimpressive. Has more glitches than Gary's mod. Disconnects ALL THE TIME. My echo dot works better. Touch screen has a delay and it seems like this little thing has to think extra hard to do anything.,"[""performance""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,wouldn't buy again. doesn't clean your feet with ease like advertised.,"[""performance""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,Would recommend. Excellent,"[""none""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Would recommend. Decent product. It gets the job done as far as cleaning and has a pumice stone. I like it.,"[""performance""]"

Amazon Fire TV Stick,Worth it!. Excellent purchase...very happy!,"[""value""]"

Kindle Paperwhite e-reader.,worse port in planet. Impossible to get charger into port -- it is too tight. Worse engineering imaginable. Device is absolutely no good to me since I cannot charge.,"[""quality""]"
Listerine pump for mouthwash,works. works perfect!,"[""performance""]"
Water Filter,Works. Works as described.  Bit expensive for the time it lasts and you would think for this kind of money it'll be cleaned.  Nope.  Have to waste a whole tray (and a day) of making black/gray ice before ice can be used.,"[""performance"",""value""]"
Anti-slip wax for glasses,Works. Okay product,"[""performance""]"
Dishwasher Magnet,works. needs a better magnet almost to big.,"[""performance""]"
Glycerin,works. I got this to help with a edible tincture and it works very well.  I must say that a small portion goes a long way.,"[""performance""]"
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Works!!. My husband has pollen sensitivity.  We put this on his side of the bed and he can definitely tell the difference in the air quality.,"[""performance""]"
Water Filter,"Works, but overpriced like all filters.. Overpriced, as all fridge filters are but it works as it should.","[""value""]"
Listerine pump for mouthwash,"Works, but not practical.. Pump works, but it squirts liquids on the upswing not just on its way down. The unexpected squirt is quite powerful and splashes the liquid already in the cup on my hands. It needs to deliver a smooth delivery on the way down only.","[""performance""]"
Kitchen Tools,"Works, but expensive. It works, but expensive for these two pieces of silicone or plastic … or, whatever material in which they are made.","[""value""]"
Tea Infuser,"Works, but discolors badly after a few uses, not worth the premium price. Had high hopes for this - paid a significant premium but it's simply not worth it. There's still a lot of plastic in it, and after a few uses and rapid, thoughtful cleaning it still discolors rapidly after only a few uses and is ultimately no better than alternatives less than half the price","[""quality"",""value""]"
Coffee Maker,Works well. I bought this AeroPress for travel. I like the taste that it produces ok... I still prefer either espresso or pour over. This produces a hybrid of the two. It does a good job on the go.,"[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,Works well.  Easy to clean.  Coffee just isn't strong enough for me though.. Works well.  Easy to clean.  Coffee just isn't strong enough for me though.,"[""performance""]"
Amazon Smart Plug,Works well.  But nite it does not support power use monitoring.. Great when on sale.  Wish it had power monitoring capability,"[""performance"",""value""]"
Hair Spray Bottle,"Works well for plants. I purchased this for my Son to use on bonsai's. He says it's nice, but not quite what he expected. He thought it would be continuous spray with holding pump down. Otherwise he is happy with it.","[""performance""]"
Amazon Fire TV Stick,Works well for most things but I am hugely disappointed that the Youtube application is no longer available. Works well for most things but I am hugely disappointed that the Youtube application is no longer available... after I bought THREE of these!,"[""performance""]"
Stain Remover,"Works well but smells like chemicals. Works well, but it smells like strong chemicals, which makes me a little nervous.","[""performance""]"
Dishwasher Magnet,"Works well but just watch your dishwasher's surface. I have a stainless steel dishwasher, and the magnet was discoloring it a bit. But I just moved it to the fridge. It's great--I use it and look at it every week.","[""performance""]"
Makeup Brush Holder ,"Works Okay. This works okay, but one part cracked rather quickly. The legs also come apart if it is lightly bumped.","[""quality""]"
Micro SD Memory Card,"Works in Sansa Clip+ running Rockbox. Presently using this with my Sansa Clip+ running Rockbox, been using it for a couple weeks without incident, so it is supported. Great if you want to run FLAC or audiobooks or both, haven't had the slightest issue.<br /><br />Also, still incredible they can fit that much space on such a tiny chip.","[""performance""]"
Anti-slip wax for glasses,Works great. Works very well and much cheaper than alternative,"[""performance"",""value""]"
Insect Repellent,"Works great. We just moved to the country. While mowing my arms got bit up terrible.  I always liked sss so I thought I would give it a try. It really works, not one bite.  Plus its a sunscreen, also moisturizes and it doesnt smell too bad.","[""performance""]"
Echo Dot,Works great!. Works great!,"[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,"Works great with experience  and trial -error!. Well I really like it but had to experiment with different grinds. Locking fittings probably could use some beefing up as it pops open when I overfill from probable over filling going by the indicator lines, makes a mess. But with use I have had pretty good luck and can get coffee as strong as I like.","[""performance"",""quality""]"
Listerine pump for mouthwash,"Works Great for kids bathroom. I needed something simple, durable, and easy to clean for my kids bathroom.  They are 2 and 3yo and learning to brush and floss their teeth, etc so this works great!","[""design"",""performance"",""quality""]"
Smart Scale,"Works Good, Syncing to Wifi Could be Improved.. My Aria scale has worked great for over a year. Easy to use daily. I just wish it wasn't such a pain to reset it and reconnect to the new network when I changed the network name. Ultimately works great though.","[""design"",""performance""]"
Insect Repellent,Works for me!. It worked for me while cutting down hedges! Has a pleasant smell and is very creamy. I love it!,"[""performance""]"
Hair Spray Bottle,"Works fine. Box was slightly damaged and the bottle itself had some scratches on it, but it still works fine. Not exactly ""new"" though.","[""quality""]"
Hair Diffuser Attachment,"Works fantastic, I think it would fit almost any dryer .... Works fantastic, I think it would fit almost any dryer because it's flexible and molds to the shape of your dryer.","[""performance""]"
Listerine pump for mouthwash,"Works as it should, however, you would need .... Works as it should, however, you would need to angle the cap you're pumping the liquid into otherwise you get sprayed on, too.","[""performance""]"

Echo Dot,Works as advertised.. All good.,"[""performance""]"
Earbuds,"Worked up to the warranty period!. I bought these as started earbuds for myself. I often lose them so I didn’t want to have to replace 150 dollar earbuds. They were working just fine until the warranty date passed. Now, I’m stuck with only a right earbud because the left refuses to charge or connect.","[""quality""]"
Coffee Scoop,Worked OK until it snapped in two.. Worked OK until it snapped in two.,"[""quality""]"
Cleaner,What's so special about these?. I bought these because I saw them recommended in some article. I don't get it....what is so special about them. Seems like a regular sponge or wash cloth and some cleanser works better.,"[""performance""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,"Was Easy on the eyes. Forces me to watch AMAZON Prime VIDEO and Alexa keeps popping up. I can not access the books that I have purchase. I've spent over $100 for books and can't even read them. Not to mention the $200 for the Fire reader. Looks like electronic waste. No help from Amazon, ever.","[""design"",""performance""]"

Water Filter,"This leaks!. I went with the GE brand and it leaks.  I’ve got a pint glass sitting underneath it and have to empty it every 1-2 days. I’ve taken it out and reinstalled it but hasn’t helped.  I’m sad because the one that was there before didn’t leak, so I know it’s not the fridge.  Schmerp.",[""quality""]
Pain Relief Cream,"this is my second order of this stuff, it .... this is my second order of this stuff, it really helps and I do not have to take pills. I use it on my neck, knees, elbows, and shoulders.","[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,"This did not fit the unit they were purchased for. Too small. It should state which unit they fit.. Is did not fit the unit they were purchased for. Too small. Rather than give the model they replace, they should state which unit they fit.<br /><br />I can not recommend this item.","[""none""]"

Wet Wipes,They're ok. Good but not the best,"[""none""]"
Coffee Filter,They sent me natural. I ordered the white bleached filters and received the natural which gives off a faint unpleasant taste to the coffee. Will not order these again.,"[""none""]"
Shower Cap,They feel cheaper now. This cap is now made smaller and thinner.  I will not buy this again,"[""quality""]"
Echo Dot,"They become less responsive over time.. They're ok, but I'm upgrading to Sonos.  Decent if you have a small place and are concerned about being considerate towards your neighbors.","[""performance""]"
Wet Wipes,They are now smaller.. They now make the Kandoo wipes smaller. I called Pampers Kandoo and they said that they make them smaller and there are supposed to be 50 in the pack. There are 42 in the pack. They are now only good for infants.,"[""quality""]"

Amazon Echo Show,"Not that easy to set up. This is not that easy to set up and I am desperate for home protection. It is frustrating to work with. Between working, going to school, and the worry of trying to protect myself from a criminal element this device has been nothing but an exercise in frustration and futility. I use it for the news and music. Some times it shows me my security camera if it is in the mood.","[""design"",""performance""]"

Cleaner,"Not Durable & Doesn't Work. I brought this for my tub since it was ranked on a list as the #1 cleaner & it was a epic fail. In less than 2 minutes of using it, it ripped. You also DEFINITELY need some sort of product on this to clean anything. This was a complete waste of $","[""performance"",""quality""]"
Peppermint Oil,No. It wasn't helpful at all. I bought it to use on the ends of my hair. Saw no improvement. The company isn't the issue it is just the oil.,[""performance""]

Amazon Fire Tablet,NO GOOGLE PLAY STORE APPS ALLOWED. This has too much bloatware and IT DOES NOT IMPORT apps from Google Play Store.,"[""performance""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,"Nice idea, poor implementation. I actually bought this as a gag gift and it worked fine for that, but it doesn't stick down to the shower floor very well, and to use the pumice portion of it, it would have to be tightly secured. They should have included better suction cups.","[""design"",""performance""]"
Water Filter,Needs better installation instructions.. I THINK THE INSTRUCTIONS NEED TO BE IMPROVED. All my water is coming out with bubbles.,[""none""]

Smart Scale,life saver. life saver,[""none""]
Foot Scrubber / Massager,"It Works. It doesn't stick that well to textured surface nor can you get it out of the way by sticking it on the shower insert. It does take up a lot of room on the shower floor. On a good note, it does allow you to clean the bottom of your feet when you are unable, for whatever reason, to lift your foot. Affordable.","[""design"",""performance"",""value""]"
Smart Scale,It appears to read 20 lbs high.. This scale is a liar.,[""performance""]
Coffee Filter,"Impractical when another person uses regular K-cup.. Too much fussing around taking out, then replacing the brewer's cup holder, not to mention all the necessary little mods to keep it from leaking and not seep grounds.  Tossing it and getting an Ekobrew...much simpler and easier to clean.",[""design""]
Smart Scale,"I like the concept of the scale. I like the concept of the scale.  I had no trouble setting it up but when it is accidentally bumped, unnoticed, the weigh-in on the screen does not shut off so therefore the batteries die faster.

Hair Clips,"Great item, very handy. I recently acquired a flat iron and wanted clips like these to section and hold my daughter's hair while we used the flat iron. These are well-made in friendly colors, and they're nicely curved rather than straight. The jaws hold well but aren't too strong. Really an ideal solution and at a great price, too.","[""design"",""performance"",""quality"",""value""]"
Smart Scale,"great - until it stops working properly.. Blargh. I used to LOVE this scale, until like others have mentioned, it just decided to stop working. It's almost like one of the feet gets stuck or something, causing it to not function properly and the batteries drain in a few days. I had it about a year before this happened - so frustrating. Before that I liked it. :(","[""quality""]"

Amazon Echo Show,"Frustrating. The voice recognition sounds ok. The user interface is straightforward, and I can’t quickly figure out how to do anything.

Insect Repellent,"FAILED!. This product did NOTHING to stop bug bites - in fact the no-see-um’s on Sanibel beach, Florida, seemed to be attracted to it. Four days later we are still itching and dealing with multiple bites. Trusted this product as well as buying the regular skin-so-soft - neither one prevented bug bites. Total spent: over $50.<br />Bug bites prevented:  NONE.","[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,"Easy To Use BUT..... I bought one of these reusable filters with the intent of using some of my favorite Starbucks blends with my Keurig Coffee Maker. Although it is easy to use, I found it a bit too messy after just popping in a K-Cup for over a year.<br /><br />It's doable, don't get me wrong, but I think I'm just spoiled with the K-Cups.","[""design"",""performance""]"
