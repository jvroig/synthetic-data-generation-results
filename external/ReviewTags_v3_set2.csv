UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"Zero affect on odor. This device works by pushing a small volume of air over a UVC light. It has no odor elimination because there is nothing in the device that could do so. It should not be marketed for odor, it’s just not possible with what this unit is capable of. Not recommended.","[""performance""]"
Amazon Fire TV Stick,Your being ripped off. Great concept but once you stop all the subscriptions your stick doesn't work anymore.,"[""value""]"
Cotton Rounds,You’ll not save your money. Good price for 4 packs. But I would like to see better quality for this price. Sometimes it feels like a little rough. The rounds are too thin and you’ll need to use more. I think it’s not worth it because you can buy more expensive one and you’ll use it same time like this one.,"[""quality"",""value""]"
Echo Dot,You’ll never regret having it in your life!!. This  Echo Dot was a gift from my son to help me navigate new technology.  BEST GIFT EVER!  How did I ever live without it!!,"[""none""]"
Earbuds,You won't go wrong with these. I love these earbuds. Incredible sound.,"[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,You have to use more than one filter. The .... You have to use more than one filter. The first time I used these filters I only used one and that turned out to be a disaster. The next cup I used 3 to be on the safe side and it was ok. So every time I want a cup of coffee i have to use 3 filters!,"[""performance""]"
Cotton Rounds,"You get your money's worth. These rub my eyes in the bad way. They're really rough, and really not that thick. I think you get what you pay for in terms of these. Obviously they still do their job, but I really wish they were softer because I feel like I'm probably getting scratches on my skin even with it soaking wet.","[""quality"",""value""]"
Hair Clips,You get what you pay for.. The quality isn't that great but its expected because of the price.,"[""quality"",""value""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,"You get what you pay for. This tab sucks compared to my last one. It runs slow and clunky. It doesn't have apps and features I want. Pretty much all I do is look at websites, social media, and read. It can't even handle that smoothly. You get what you pay for. I will spend the money for something better next time.","[""performance"",""value""]"
False Eyelashes,You get what you paid for.. The &#34;hairs&#34; are easily detached and they are mounted on a flimsy piece of string. Very difficult to put on.,"[""design"",""quality""]"
Echo Dot,You can't see the light! You don't know if she heard you. I bought a couple of these for Prime Day - as replacements for older ones - but the fact that the light ring is now on the bottom has everyone in my house is constantly yelling because we never know if she heard us or not.<br />Huge annoyance.,"[""design""]"
Yoga Mat Cleaner,Yogies welcome. Nice for the price!,"[""value""]"
Glycerin,Yes. Yes,"[""non-review""]"
Back Cushion,Yea. Ordered this for my Mom who lives all day in a nursing home. So far this seems to be working great for her when so many cushions before haven't.,"[""performance""]"
Soft Tissues,Wrong item. I usually order the Vicks puff tissue but I orders the wron one by accident,"[""non-review""]"
Earplugs,"Wow. I'm really surprised these work. I wear them when I go out with friends and have found it much easier to hear them over the music, besides the music being much more tolerable. My ears aren't ringing when I leave and take them out, so my migraines aren't triggered as easily. Very happy with this purchase, I just wish they were a tiny bit more effective with the music.","[""performance""]"
Amazon Echo Show,Wouldn't buy again. Slow and generally unimpressive. Has more glitches than Gary's mod. Disconnects ALL THE TIME. My echo dot works better. Touch screen has a delay and it seems like this little thing has to think extra hard to do anything.,"[""performance""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,wouldn't buy again. doesn't clean your feet with ease like advertised.,"[""performance""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,Would recommend. Excellent,"[""none""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Would recommend. Decent product. It gets the job done as far as cleaning and has a pumice stone. I like it.,"[""performance""]"
Earbuds,Worth the price. Can’t complain about these. Well worth the price. Better than average sound.,"[""value"",""performance""]"
Amazon Fire TV Stick,Worth it!. Excellent purchase...very happy!,"[""value""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,Worth every penny. Excellent tablet. I get everything I want with no trouble.,"[""value""]"
Kindle Paperwhite e-reader.,worse port in planet. Impossible to get charger into port -- it is too tight. Worse engineering imaginable. Device is absolutely no good to me since I cannot charge.,"[""quality""]"
Listerine pump for mouthwash,works. works perfect!,"[""performance""]"
Water Filter,Works. Works as described.  Bit expensive for the time it lasts and you would think for this kind of money it'll be cleaned.  Nope.  Have to waste a whole tray (and a day) of making black/gray ice before ice can be used.,"[""performance"",""value""]"
Anti-slip wax for glasses,Works. Okay product,"[""performance""]"
Dishwasher Magnet,works. needs a better magnet almost to big.,"[""performance""]"
Glycerin,works. I got this to help with a edible tincture and it works very well.  I must say that a small portion goes a long way.,"[""performance""]"
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Works!!. My husband has pollen sensitivity.  We put this on his side of the bed and he can definitely tell the difference in the air quality.,"[""performance""]"
Water Filter,"Works, but overpriced like all filters.. Overpriced, as all fridge filters are but it works as it should.","[""value""]"
Listerine pump for mouthwash,"Works, but not practical.. Pump works, but it squirts liquids on the upswing not just on its way down. The unexpected squirt is quite powerful and splashes the liquid already in the cup on my hands. It needs to deliver a smooth delivery on the way down only.","[""performance""]"
Kitchen Tools,"Works, but expensive. It works, but expensive for these two pieces of silicone or plastic … or, whatever material in which they are made.","[""value""]"
Tea Infuser,"Works, but discolors badly after a few uses, not worth the premium price. Had high hopes for this - paid a significant premium but it's simply not worth it. There's still a lot of plastic in it, and after a few uses and rapid, thoughtful cleaning it still discolors rapidly after only a few uses and is ultimately no better than alternatives less than half the price","[""quality"",""value""]"
Coffee Maker,Works well. I bought this AeroPress for travel. I like the taste that it produces ok... I still prefer either espresso or pour over. This produces a hybrid of the two. It does a good job on the go.,"[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,Works well.  Easy to clean.  Coffee just isn't strong enough for me though.. Works well.  Easy to clean.  Coffee just isn't strong enough for me though.,"[""performance""]"
Amazon Smart Plug,Works well.  But nite it does not support power use monitoring.. Great when on sale.  Wish it had power monitoring capability,"[""performance"",""value""]"
Hair Spray Bottle,"Works well for plants. I purchased this for my Son to use on bonsai's. He says it's nice, but not quite what he expected. He thought it would be continuous spray with holding pump down. Otherwise he is happy with it.","[""performance""]"
Amazon Fire TV Stick,Works well for most things but I am hugely disappointed that the Youtube application is no longer available. Works well for most things but I am hugely disappointed that the Youtube application is no longer available... after I bought THREE of these!,"[""performance""]"
Stain Remover,"Works well but smells like chemicals. Works well, but it smells like strong chemicals, which makes me a little nervous.","[""performance""]"
Dishwasher Magnet,"Works well but just watch your dishwasher's surface. I have a stainless steel dishwasher, and the magnet was discoloring it a bit. But I just moved it to the fridge. It's great--I use it and look at it every week.","[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,"works very well. I bought these to stop the sludge that was appearing in each cup, that work.  It does take a few cups to get used to inserting the filter....and the grounds can flow over the top but for the most part this does what I expected.","[""performance""]"
Coffee Maker Cups,"Works pretty well and definitely does the job.. Works pretty well. The coffee tastes fine, it is a little messier to use than pre-packaged K-cups. But it definitely does the job.","[""performance""]"
Amazon Smart Plug,Works perfectly!. I use it on a Living room floor lamp that is behind a large recliner. No more do I stretch dangerously to reach the lamp on/off switch.,"[""performance""]"
Stain Remover,"Works on new stains, but not old ones. It has worked fairly well on some stains, but for stains that have been sitting there for a bit already this does not work well and I had to use OxiClean.","[""performance""]"
Stain Remover,Works on most / new stains. I already use this brand’s odor eliminator and detergent which i love so I decided to try the stain remover. First time using it. Top row of collage pics are before and bottom row is after. Worked well on some old stains but didn’t work on others. Didn’t get a before pic of the pink & white romper but it worked on an old stain that was on there.,"[""performance""]"
Makeup Brush Holder ,"Works Okay. This works okay, but one part cracked rather quickly. The legs also come apart if it is lightly bumped.","[""quality""]"
Coffee Scoop,Works ok. So far it seems to work ok,"[""performance""]"
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Works ok!. I used this when I had walking pneumonia. I was still sick for 2 months while using this. Maybe it works better as a preventative instead of after you are sick.,"[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,Works OK but some of this type of unit do not work well in Keurig 2.0 machines. These types of units often are erratic in Kuerig b2.0 machines. I use it occasionally and am mostly satisfied.,"[""performance""]"
Makeup Brush Holder ,Works like a charm.. This makeup brush holder comes packed flat. It is easy to assemble and use. I like that I can disassemble it for storage when not in use. It also cleans very easily.,"[""design"",""performance""]"
Tea Infuser,"works just as expected. I have purchased this exact same tea strainer years ago and left it in a different city.  Works well, and it fits most cups and mugs.","[""performance""]"
Micro SD Memory Card,"Works in Sansa Clip+ running Rockbox. Presently using this with my Sansa Clip+ running Rockbox, been using it for a couple weeks without incident, so it is supported. Great if you want to run FLAC or audiobooks or both, haven't had the slightest issue.<br /><br />Also, still incredible they can fit that much space on such a tiny chip.","[""performance""]"
Hair curler,Works greattttt. Beautiful curls super cheap and gets HOT fastttt love it,"[""performance"",""value""]"
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Works great.. Bought this for the bathroom that houses the cat litter box. Works awesome and we don’t even notice the smell of the litter box.,"[""performance""]"

Tea Infuser,"Works great. Works great, can make an entire pot of tea","[""performance""]"
Water Filter,Works great. Work great,"[""performance""]"
Insect Repellent,"Works great. We just moved to the country. While mowing my arms got bit up terrible.  I always liked sss so I thought I would give it a try. It really works, not one bite.  Plus its a sunscreen, also moisturizes and it doesnt smell too bad.","[""performance""]"
Hair Brush,Works great. This brush works great and arrived quickly,"[""performance""]"
Echo Dot,"Works great. Sounds good for a small speaker, I have 2 of them connected to a sub woofer for my fire tv stick.","[""performance""]"
Amazon Smart Plug,Works great. put it on a lamp,"[""performance""]"
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"Works Great. I think this little air purifier works great. It is NOT noisy, as others have opined. There is a low grade, subtle whir that comes from the unit when it's running but not disruptive at all. With the purchase!","[""performance""]"
Tea Infuser,Works Great. I read that making tea from the leaves and not the bag is healthier.  So I bought this and it works well.,"[""performance""]"
Listerine pump for mouthwash,Works great. I have seen these used at my Dentist office on their mouthwash bottles. I asked where to get them no-one could tell me. So very happy I found them on Amazon. Works great.,"[""performance""]"
Soap Sheets,"Works great. Did the job. Definitely remember - dry fingers only when pulling out the soap sheets. For a pair of washable black trousers, I had to use two sheets, but they came clean in the hotel sink!","[""performance""]"
Tea Infuser,Works great. Bought this to use with my new teapot and loose leaf tea. Works great and makes it easy to reuse the tea leaves.,"[""performance""]"
Echo Dot,Works great!. Works great!,"[""performance""]"
Logitech Mouse,"Works Great!. Took a little getting use to, but once you get a hang of it, you'll love it!","[""performance""]"
Coffee Maker Cups,"Works great, easy to clean. I am not sure what type of Keurig I have but this works great in it!  It sits up high enough so it does not get punctured like a regular k-cup does.  I would recommend this product.  Works great and easy to clean.  Like that the bottom is screen like the sides.","[""design"",""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,"Works great with experience  and trial -error!. Well I really like it but had to experiment with different grinds. Locking fittings probably could use some beefing up as it pops open when I overfill from probable over filling going by the indicator lines, makes a mess. But with use I have had pretty good luck and can get coffee as strong as I like.","[""performance"",""quality""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Works great however. It works great however when you slide your foot it slides too.,"[""performance""]"
Glycerin,Works great for softening Eucalyptus leaves. I bought this to soak Eucalyptus leaves in for use in arrangements.  Works great - you can find detailed instructions online.  Also good as a dry skin moisturizer - I like that it's all natural!,"[""performance""]"
Listerine pump for mouthwash,"Works Great for kids bathroom. I needed something simple, durable, and easy to clean for my kids bathroom.  They are 2 and 3yo and learning to brush and floss their teeth, etc so this works great!","[""design"",""performance"",""quality""]"
Amazon Echo Show,Works great for all needs. I keep Alexa in my kitchen and it comes in super handy for when I am cooking and need to look up recipes or see what I can substitute in different things as I am cooking.,"[""performance""]"
Micro SD Memory Card,"Works great at good price. Works as intended, no issues.","[""performance"",""value""]"
Water Filter,"Works great AND.... Make sure you let it run for a bit, at least half a day of use; the initial water is really WEIRD and taste even worse.","[""performance""]"
Exfoliating Cloth,Works good. Took some time to get used to.,"[""performance""]"
Smart Scale,"Works Good, Syncing to Wifi Could be Improved.. My Aria scale has worked great for over a year. Easy to use daily. I just wish it wasn't such a pain to reset it and reconnect to the new network when I changed the network name. Ultimately works great though.","[""design"",""performance""]"
Water Filter,Works for only 2 months and OVERPRICED. We had this filter for only 2 months before it needed to be replaced - our water was down to a trickle.  The price is outrageous and we have switched to just using a brita filter because spending $50 every 2 months after we paid for this expensive fridge is ridiculous.,"[""performance"",""value""]"
Peppermint Oil,"Works for my purpose. Use it to mix with essential oils. So far, so good.","[""performance""]"
Insect Repellent,Works for me!. It worked for me while cutting down hedges! Has a pleasant smell and is very creamy. I love it!,"[""performance""]"

Coffee Scoop,"Works fine. This works fine, but the scoop is a little big and over fills the k-cup size capsule.","[""performance""]"
Water Filter,Works fine. It's a filter to replace the one I had and it seems to be working just fine. Not sure what else I can tell you...,"[""performance""]"
Hair Spray Bottle,"Works fine. Box was slightly damaged and the bottle itself had some scratches on it, but it still works fine. Not exactly “new” though.","[""quality""]"
Hair Diffuser Attachment,"Works fantastic, I think it would fit almost any dryer .... Works fantastic, I think it would fit almost any dryer because it's flexible and molds to the shape of your dryer.","[""performance""]"
Eyebrow Tint,Works as promised. Works good,"[""performance""]"
Listerine pump for mouthwash,"Works as it should, however, you would need .... Works as it should, however, you would need to angle the cap you're pumping the liquid into otherwise you get sprayed on, too.","[""performance""]"
Dishwasher Magnet,"Works as intended. Works like it's supposed to, can't complain and I think that's a good review right there!","[""performance""]"
Micro SD Memory Card,Works as expected.. Purchased this card for my LG G Vista 2 cell phone.. It fits fine and is working properly.,"[""performance""]"
Kitchen Tools,"Works as expected. This product does what is is supposed to do. However my only complaint and it is minor, I wish that it came with tape or adhesive which kept it in place.","[""performance""]"
Echo Dot,Works as advertised.. All good.,"[""performance""]"
Stain Remover,Works alright. Not as good as the Baby Oxi Clean. Package came with one bottle leaking into the package. I do like the smell though and the fact that it's better for baby. It works after a couple washes and as long as you do it right away.,"[""performance"",""quality""]"
Hair Diffuser Attachment,Worked well. Worked well on my long curly hair.,"[""performance""]"
Earbuds,"Worked up to the warranty period!. I bought these as started earbuds for myself. I often lose them so I didn’t want to have to replace 150 dollar earbuds. They were working just fine until the warranty date passed. Now, I’m stuck with only a right earbud because the left refuses to charge or connect.","[""quality""]"
Coffee Scoop,Worked OK until it snapped in two.. Worked OK until it snapped in two.,"[""quality""]"
Insect Repellent,Worked great keeping mosquitoes away. Worked great keeping mosquitoes away,"[""performance""]"
Echo Dot,Worked for less than a year. Suddenly stopped working. Amazon refuses to refund or replace if it’s a month after purchase date. Don’t waste your money.,"[""quality""]"
Hair Spray Bottle,Work well. Make sure you clean it every now and then if you have well water because mineral build up is real. Other than that it’s a fine mist and works great for doing my daughters hair!,"[""performance""]"
Coffee Maker Cups,Work well in a Keurig. Bought these for our own use. They work well. Much cheaper to use these than to buy k-cups. Loved them so now give as gifts to Keurig owners. Put in top rack of dishwasher. Fill them to the top or coffee not strong enough. Happy with this purchase.,"[""performance"",""value""]"
Wet Wipes,Work well for my toddler. These work well for my toddler.  I bought the kind in the plastic case before and they were horrible as they dried out before we got through half a box.  These soft tubs are much better at staying wet.,"[""performance""]"
Water Filter,Work great on GE profile refrigerators.. FILTER WORKS FOR 6 MONTHS,"[""performance""]"
Earplugs,"Work as advertised! I do a lot of parties .... Work as advertised! I do a lot of parties, and always have years. This helps extremely well. If you want to be able to still hear people in the music, this product is for you.","[""performance""]"
Hair curler,Wonderful choice. Hard to go wrong with this brand!,"[""none""]"
Hairspray,Won’t spray!!!. This is not the first time I’ve ordered this product but neither bottle sprays and i can’t return them nor can I get a hold of anyone at AMAZON to replace them or refund my money,"[""quality""]"
Soft Tissues,Wish there were more tissues per box.. They don’t last long.,"[""quality""]"
Echo Dot,Wish it worked better. A little disappointed. She understands a lot but she also says she can't find whatever I'm asking her to lookup quiet a bit.,"[""performance""]"
Hair Spray Bottle,Wish it held more. I love this bottle. Use it everyday just to mist my hair with my moisturizing concoction. But I wish it held more water.,"[""performance""]"
Back Cushion,Will Not Stay in Place. Will not stay in place on back on chair!,"[""performance""]"
Bluetooth Speakers,Will NOT connect with my Roku smart TV.. I've tired and tried to connect the speaker via bluetooth and it will not connect.,"[""performance""]"
Soft Tissues,Will buy somewhere else. Will not order again.  All the boxes were crushed.  Love the Kleenex with lotion but will not buy for Amazon again.,"[""quality""]"
Amazon Fire TV Stick,Will buy again!. So happy with our Fire Stick. Best idea ever to get one. Only con is that it disconnects easily from out internet but I think that’s more an internet and distance from router problem than the device itself.,"[""performance""]"
Kindle Tablet ,WiFi hot spot from iPhone 7 won’t connect. Can’t connect my WiFi hot spot from my iPhone 7s to amazon fire my phone sees it but amazon doesn’t! It is useless if it doesn’t connect you need to make this seem less if you want my business,"[""performance""]"
Echo Dot,"White cord?. I enjoy the electronics part, but why do you make a black product with a white power cord?<br /><br />Makes no sense","[""design""]"
Water Filter,"Whirlpool will not honor a replacement if purchased from Amzone. This is the first issue I am having with this filter, but when we put this one on water leak all over the floor, my husband tried twice, each time he put the old on back there was no issue he put this one in and is is obviously  defective. BUT because I ordered it from Amazon Whirlpool will not honor a replacement.","[""quality""]"
Cleaner,What's so special about these?. I bought these because I saw them recommended in some article. I don't get it....what is so special about them. Seems like a regular sponge or wash cloth and some cleanser works better.,"[""performance""]"
Bluetooth Speakers,"What sound ?. The sound is really weak , it’s only fair - had a tin like sound - nothing what is advertised!<br /><br />I would not buy again !","[""performance""]"
Eyebrow Tint,"What happened???. How is this dark brown? Compare the 2 pics. One labeled Med. Brown, is both darker in the capsules,  and after being mixed.  I didn't dare try the lighter one, although I did apply it side by side on a paper towel. No way!!  I have been using this for a couple years, never seen this before. I WILL BE ASKING FOR A REPLACEMENT.","[""quality""]"
Hair Spray Bottle,Wet Deluge. Sprayer puts out too much water in my opinion.,"[""performance""]"

Earplugs,We use these in the Jazz clubs to tone down .... We use these in the Jazz clubs to tone down enthusiastic players.  Don't take them to the gun range and expect any kind of protection.  That's not their intention.,"[""performance""]"
Smart Scale,We love the new scale. We love the new scale!  It post our weight each day onto our Fitbit app. The scale is helping us live a healthier life style.,"[""performance""]"

Amazon Smart Plug,We like it. Worked well for our chriatmas tree.,"[""performance""]"
Dishwasher Magnet,way too big belongs on an ocean liner refrigerator. far too big for residential use. Gaudy !,"[""design""]"
Water Filter,Way Over Priced. There just is no good reason for this filter to come $50.  I have moved on to an after market brand and I am completely satisfied.  I can tell absolutely no difference in performance and  get three filters for less  than i paid at Best Buy for this one Samsung brand filter.,"[""value""]"
Amazon Smart Plug,Way over priced for what it is. Way over priced. Does what its supposed to do but way cheaper options out there.,"[""value""]"
Water Filter,"Water flow after 2 months is very low. installation was pretty easy. Water flavor was great and even worked fine for the first couple of months. But now the water flow is terrible, takes forever to fill a normal sized water bottle.","[""performance""]"
Water Filter,water filter. Item was unfortunately damaged and returned for refund.  The filter was in the plastic wrap and the filter lid was off track.,"[""quality""]"
Anti-slip wax for glasses,"Wasteful design. Bad product shape chapstick tube, for getting at the nose pads of your glasses. Now if you want to keep your glasses from sliding off your lips your covered.","[""design""]"
Makeup Brush Holder ,Waste of Money. Very cheap!!!! I went and purchased a automatic brush washer.,"[""value""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,waste of money. this product was a waste of money.  the pumice stone fell out as well as all the bristles and the suction cups after a few moves would not go back into the holes they belonged in.,"[""quality""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,Wasn't what I need. Nice,"[""none""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,"Was Easy on the eyes. Forces me to watch AMAZON Prime VIDEO and Alexa keeps popping up. I can not access the books that I have purchase. I've spent over $100 for books and can't even read them. Not to mention the $200 for the Fire reader. Looks like electronic waste. No help from Amazon, ever.","[""design"",""performance""]"
Earbuds,Warning. Speakers do not play at the same volume. Who knows how long they will even last if they come out of the box like that,"[""quality""]"
Cotton Rounds,Very thin. Very thin and is made cheap.. I have to use two at a time or else it's too thin and just absorbs everything and I can't even sweep it across my face.,"[""quality""]"
Cotton Rounds,Very thin. These are okay but are pretty thin with little absorbancy.,"[""quality""]"
Cotton Rounds,"Very thin. I guess they are ok for the price, but very thin and you might need to double them.","[""quality"",""value""]"
Soft Tissues,"Very rough. These are fine for everyday use but during a cold/allergies they are painfully rough. I almost wonder if we got a defective batch without lotion, based on all of the other good reviews.","[""quality""]"
Crown / Tiara,"Very pretty tiara. I really like it. My daughter said it was too heavy, but she is picky about tiaras. She also prefers the headband kind instead of the combs on this kind. It is beautiful and looks well made.","[""design"",""quality""]"
Coffee Filter,Very poor quality. Waned to return but says not eligible.  Should have stuck with Keurig & not generic,"[""quality""]"
Kindle Paperwhite e-reader.,Very pleased.. Should have upgraded a long time ago.  Terrific battery life.,"[""performance""]"
Anti-slip wax for glasses,"Very pleased with this. Love this product! Works just like it says it will, awesome.","[""performance""]"
Yoga Mat Cleaner,"Very nice smell, not pungent. I like this cleaner more than the last one I purchased.  The lavender smell is not pungent, just enough to give a nice aroma.  Cleans my mat very well.","[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,Very low quality. Unusable. Seam falls apart when in touch with hot coffee. It should not be sold because it's defective. I wasted my money.,"[""quality""]"
Kindle Tablet ,"Very happy customer!. Love this device, it’s perfect size and the quality is out of this world, not to mention the color is beautiful  . I love it too because it’s simple almost ready to use because it’s simple to understand how to use. Great but !","[""design"",""quality""]"
Soap Sheets,"Very handy, small and lightweight. Very handy to keep in purse for emergency","[""design""]"
Cleaner,Very good product.. Does a great job cleaning.,"[""performance""]"
Makeup Brush Holder ,Very flimsy. This is very flimsy not good at all,"[""quality""]"
Contact Lens Solution,"Very disappointed. I was pleased at first but now I am not.  NO matter how long I leave my contacts in, my eyes burn from this solution..  Even after I rinsed my lenses with saline solution they still burned my eyes.  SO I stopped using this and went back to Bausch and Lomb Bio True lens solution!","[""performance""]"
Hair curler,Very Curly. Does exactly as it says. Makes my hair very curly! I have thin/finer hair so I do not need to leave it wrapped around as long to get curls.,"[""performance""]"
Bath Towel / Wrap,Velcro doesn't last long. The Velcro is already started to have issues staying together after 6 months or so. The last wrap I had for 6 years (different brand).  The fabric wasn't the best either-it felt weird. But I've had a difficult time finding a good wrap in stores so thought I'd try Amazon. I'll try another brand and see if the Velcro is better.,"[""quality""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,utter crap. They block you from using Google play store. Charging is slow. USB debugging doesnt give root permissions.,"[""performance""]"
Contact Lens Solution,"User for 2 decades. I've been wearing contact lenses since 1973.  This product works better than anything I've ever tried, particularly when your lenses are grimy from pollution and irritants.  The generics are fine, but the Alcon brand is really the best.","[""performance""]"
Stain Remover,Useless. This product is completely useless. It will not remove any stain from any article of clothing. If I didn't know any better I would assume that this is simply Dreft scented water. I would stay away from these products unless you just really love the scent of Dreft.,"[""performance""]"
Makeup Brush Holder ,Useful. I really like the different holes for makeup brushes. It's a very solid piece. Comes in 3 pieces with paper sticker over entire piece of both sides. It comes was a pain to remove. Luckily I have nails.,"[""design"",""quality""]"
Earbuds,"Used 4 times, right stopped working. Wife was past return time before she started using them, after about 4 uses the right ear piece stopped working. Make sure to try them a few times as soon as you get them!","[""quality""]"
Pain Relief Cream,Use for IC.... I used this when I have a flare up with IC...I mix with coconut oil and topical put on bladder area.  Seems to calm it down,"[""performance""]"
Cleaner,Use for everything. I wish I knew how these worked. I had a really old shower that was stained and just plain ugly. I gave up on all other products and tried the Magic Eraser. It took all the old stains off the shower.,"[""performance""]"
Earbuds,Unreliable. I will be returning these. They are less than a week old with me and they turn off while in use on a phone call on full charge. Very unreliable.,"[""performance""]"
Anti-slip wax for glasses,Two Stars. Works for five minutes. If you sweat at all don't purchase this product.,"[""performance""]"
