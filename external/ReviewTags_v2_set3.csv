Insect Repellent,"Works great. We just moved to the country. While mowing my arms got bit up terrible.  I always liked sss so I thought I would give it a try. It really works, not one bite.  Plus its a sunscreen, also moisturizes and it doesnt smell too bad.","[""performance""]"
Smart Scale,"Works Good, Syncing to Wifi Could be Improved.. My Aria scale has worked great for over a year. Easy to use daily. I just wish it wasn't such a pain to reset it and reconnect to the new network when I changed the network name. Ultimately works great though.","[""design"",""performance""]"
Insect Repellent,Works for me!. It worked for me while cutting down hedges! Has a pleasant smell and is very creamy. I love it!,"[""performance""]"
Cleaner,What's so special about these?. I bought these because I saw them recommended in some article. I don't get it....what is so special about them. Seems like a regular sponge or wash cloth and some cleanser works better.,"[""performance""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,"Was Easy on the eyes. Forces me to watch AMAZON Prime VIDEO and Alexa keeps popping up. I can not access the books that I have purchase. I've spent over $100 for books and can't even read them. Not to mention the $200 for the Fire reader. Looks like electronic waste. No help from Amazon, ever.","[""design"",""performance""]"
Micro SD Memory Card,Three Stars. its a memory card... it keeps memory,"[""non-review""]"
Water Filter,"This leaks!. I went with the GE brand and it leaks.  I’ve got a pint glass sitting underneath it and have to empty it every 1-2 days. I’ve taken it out and reinstalled it but hasn’t helped.  I’m sad because the one that was there before didn’t leak, so I know it’s not the fridge.  Schmerp.",[“quality”]
False Eyelashes,These were affordable and very natural but since the length .... These were affordable and very natural but since the length isn't varied you can't really even tell that you're wearing lashes.,"[""quality"",""value""]"

Insect Repellent,One Star. Oily,[“quality”]

Water Filter,once installed the water had bad aftertaste - sent it back. had to send it back - it is easy to install but the water had an after taste once installed - i did reset my refrigerator filter button a few times but still had a aftertaste,[“performance”]
Amazon Echo Show,"Not that easy to set up. This is not that easy to set up and I am desperate for home protection. It is frustrating to work with. Between working, going to school, and the worry of trying to protect myself from a criminal element this device has been nothing but an exercise in frustration and futility. I use it for the news and music. Some times it shows me my security camera if it is in the mood.","[""design"",""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,NOT FOR KEURIG 2.0. The description didn't state that this cup won't fit a Keurig 2.0. Was easy to return for an account credit.,[“none”]
Coffee Filter,"Not for 2.0. My kids have one. Works great but, not in my new 2.0 machine. They do not tell you that until you read the directions",[“quality”]
Cleaner,"Not Durable & Doesn't Work. I brought this for my tub since it was ranked on a list as the #1 cleaner & it was a epic fail. In less than 2 minutes of using it, it ripped. You also DEFINITELY need some sort of product on this to clean anything. This was a complete waste of $","[""performance"",""quality""]"
Peppermint Oil,No. It wasn't helpful at all. I bought it to use on the ends of my hair. Saw no improvement. The company isn't the issue it is just the oil.,[“performance”]
Cleaner,"No magic. There is nothing magic about these, they are worthless","[""none""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,NO GOOGLE PLAY STORE APPS ALLOWED. This has too much bloatware and IT DOES NOT IMPORT apps from Google Play Store.,"[""performance""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,"Nice idea, poor implementation. I actually bought this as a gag gift and it worked fine for that, but it doesn't stick down to the shower floor very well, and to use the pumice portion of it, it would have to be tightly secured. They should have included better suction cups.","[“design”,”performance”]"
Water Filter,Needs better installation instructions.. I THINK THE INSTRUCTIONS NEED TO BE IMPROVED. All my water is coming out with bubbles.,[“none”]
Foot Scrubber / Massager,My opinion. Rating based on my opinion and product use. The rating needs to be a drop down only and not require someone to write an additional response. You will get better data with the multiple choice questions.,[“non-review”]
Amazon Echo Show,Love it!. Its my favorite of all of mine.  I like the weather and clock and tips,"[""none""]"
Smart Scale,life saver. life saver,[“none”]
Foot Scrubber / Massager,"It Works. It doesn't stick that well to textured surface nor can you get it out of the way by sticking it on the shower insert. It does take up a lot of room on the shower floor. On a good note, it does allow you to clean the bottom of your feet when you are unable, for whatever reason, to lift your foot. Affordable.","[""design"",""performance"",""value""]"
Smart Scale,It appears to read 20 lbs high.. This scale is a liar.,[“performance”]
Coffee Filter,"Impractical when another person uses regular K-cup.. Too much fussing around taking out, then replacing the brewer's cup holder, not to mention all the necessary little mods to keep it from leaking and not seep grounds.  Tossing it and getting an Ekobrew...much simpler and easier to clean.",[“design”]
Smart Scale,"I like the concept of the scale. I like the concept of the scale.  I had no trouble setting it up but when it is accidentally bumped, unnoticed, the weigh-in on the screen does not shut off so therefore the batteries die faster.  It seems I am constantly changing the batteries.",[“design”]
Coffee Filter,here mom.. Bought this for my Minie Keurig and it didnt fit. Even though it said everywhere i looked that it would. So my mom got a new one for her Keurig.,[“none”]
Amazon Fire Tablet,"hate this tablet 10 "" is what im used to slow to charge, no alexa working, sending back asap.. cannot get ALEXA to work. brand new tab. took 6 hours to fully charge. no google mail. no free phone calls u just use this fire tab to speak thru using your own connection. hate it. sending back. bad experience overall.","[""performance""]"
Smart Scale,"Great Scale, heafty price. I got this scale because I started using the fit bit one.  While it's great and more accurate than my previous scale, it's pretty pricey. I'm not sure it was worth the price.","[""performance"",""value""]"
Logitech Mouse,"Great mouse!. I love this mouse, it’s much easier to game with and easier to cover your hand to keep it warm if you have bad circulation.<br /><br />I’ve been using it for years and my little brother has one too - he also loves it.",[“performance”]
Hair Clips,"Great item, very handy. I recently acquired a flat iron and wanted clips like these to section and hold my daughter's hair while we used the flat iron. These are well-made in friendly colors, and they're nicely curved rather than straight. The jaws hold well but aren't too strong. Really an ideal solution and at a great price, too.","[""design"",""performance"",”quality”,""value""]"
Smart Scale,"great - until it stops working properly.. Blargh. I used to LOVE this scale, until like others have mentioned, it just decided to stop working. It's almost like one of the feet gets stuck or something, causing it to not function properly and the batteries drain in a few days. I had it about a year before this happened - so frustrating. Before that I liked it. :(","[""quality""]"
Insect Repellent,Gave my son a rash on his cheek when applied .... Gave my son a rash on his cheek when applied.  Next time just use regular sunscreen and buy one of those mosquito repellent bracelets.,[“quality”]
Amazon Echo Show,"Frustrating. The voice recognition sounds ok. The user interface is straightforward, and I can’t quickly figure out how to do anything.  I have two older Alexa speakers that I love and this was a good. I thought I could use this in the kitchen. It’s easier just not to let my phone lock bc I don’t readily see otherwise.","[""design""]"
False Eyelashes,Four Stars. very big,"[""design""]"
Water Filter,"Four Stars. A little more pricey than I would have liked, but it works perfectly.","[“performance”,”value”]"
Insect Repellent,For 10.99 it's small. Really small,[“value”]
Shower Cap,Five Stars. good fit and value,"[""design"",""value""]"

Amazon Fire Tablet,Fire HD 10 Tablet. Didn't realize you couldn't play games on this device.,"[""non-review""]"
Water Filter,filter. I was upset that when it says pack it not more than one. False advertising. Pack means 2 or more not one.,[“non-review”]
Insect Repellent,"FAILED!. This product did NOTHING to stop bug bites - in fact the no-see-um’s on Sanibel beach, Florida, seemed to be attracted to it. Four days later we are still itching and dealing with multiple bites. Trusted this product as well as buying the regular skin-so-soft - neither one prevented bug bites. Total spent: over $50.<br />Bug bites prevented:  NONE.","[""performance""]"
Coffee Filter,"Easy To Use BUT..... I bought one of these reusable filters with the intent of using some of my favorite Starbucks blends with my Keurig Coffee Maker. Although it is easy to use, I found it a bit too messy after just popping in a K-Cup for over a year.<br /><br />It's doable, don't get me wrong, but I think I'm just spoiled with the K-Cups.","[“design”,”performance”]"
Water Filter,"easy to install. So far it's working good  I have no complaints,The water taste good and is coming out at a good pace.","[“design”,”performance”]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,"easy feet. I do not recommend this product.  There is no ""well"" for the soap, the suction cups do not stick to my tile and the pumice stone arrived broken.  All-in-all, not a good $25 investment.","[“design”,”performance”,”quality”,”value”]"
Cleaner,Don't hold together very well. I tried to remove baked on gunk on my cookie sheets but not very successful. These fell apart after use with a little elbow grease. Won't buy again,"[""performance"",""quality""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,"Don't bother.... Worst foot cleaner out there. Heavy and clunky.  Buy the suction cup type you can hang on the outside (or inside) of the tub. I did not buy this on Amazon, I bought it at a drugstore and returned it the next day.",[“design”]
Coffee Filter,Doesn't fit. Doesn't fit,[“none”]
Coffee Filter,Doesn't Fit in the Keurig K155 properly. the sliver .... Doesn't Fit in the Keurig K155 properly. the sliver piece sticks up farther than the original piece and the filter can't fit into the original piece. it still works but the spout is slightly in the machine still.,"[“design”,”quality”]"
Insect Repellent,didn't see much difference from using the Skin-So-Soft and this .... didn't see much difference from using the Skin-So-Soft and this product.  I will just use the Skin-So-Soft in the future.,[“performance”]
Amazon Fire Tablet,Did not like it. Returned,"[""none""]"
Amazon Fire Tablet,Dead spot on screen now....5 weeks after warranty expired.. Used only to listen to books at night...barely used.  Am dissatisfied with this product. I have hardly used this.<br /><br />On the right side of the screen there is a dead zone about the size of a business card. Only found out when i went to play a game.,"[""quality""]"
Shower Cap,"Cute but small. It is really cute, the material is okay, but is way to small to cover my hair up. I use it anyway, but I would have rather a bigger cap.",[“design”]
Water Filter,Clorine taste present. Still have that clorine taste,[“performance”]
Logitech Mouse,"Cheaply made. Had higher expectations. Weak, loose, noisy. The roller ball is a distraction instead of an asset. Trying for years to replace a Microsoft Trac-ball. This is a swing and a miss.","[“performance”,“value”]"
Coffee Filter,Careful that your Keurig Machine allows the use of this item.. Unfortunately I have the Keurig 2.0 machine and it doesn't allow you to use this K-cup filter.,[“none”]
Insect Repellent,Bug Guard in Lotion Form. Haven't used it a great deal yet but I like the idea of a bug guard in lotion form.  It is exactly as described & arrived promptly.,[“non-review”]
Coffee Filter,Be careful to check which machines it fits before ordering. Doesn't fit my machine,[“none”]
Insect Repellent,"Balls up like typical AVON product. First, i don't like the smell.<br /><br />Second, it balls up like crazy. I find myself keep rubbing my arms and wherever I put this on.<br /><br />Gosh.....",[“quality”]
Insect Repellent,"Awful.. Awful, watery ""lotion*. It was supposed to be a lotion, not water???<br />Also, keeps 0 bugs abay. Gave me skin rash.  Don't even bother.","[""performance"", ""quality""]"
