Amazon Echo Show,"Not necessary if one owns a smartphone and we all do. Even at $20, it was a waste of money.. Not necessary if one owns a smartphone and we all do.  In fact, it's very annoying, one cannot even use one's Amazon music account. Even at $20, it was a waste of money.",Negative
Amazon Echo Show,"Not that easy to set up. This is not that easy to set up and I am desperate for home protection. It is frustrating to work with. Between working, going to school, and the worry of trying to protect myself from a criminal element this device has been nothing but an exercise in frustration and futility.

I mostly use this product to read and thought that Kindle unlimited came with it for 3 months as a trial but when I chose Kindle books, they were taken off my que as I didn't pay for them.

Amazon Fire Tablet,Nice. I like my tablet. Alexa doesn't work well hands free.,Slightly Positive
Amazon Fire Tablet,Nice. My tablet works nicely but it's pretty slow for it being an updated version. I also noticed the storage shows I have 45.57 GB free of 57.29 GB when I am supposed to have 64 GB. Maybe it's because of all the apps that come preloaded? I have no idea. Overall I do like it and I use it almost everyday.,Slightly Positive
Amazon Fire Tablet,No charge. Do not hold a charge,Slightly Negative

Amazon Fire Tablet,"Poor battery life. I bought this so I could stream movies and play games during a flight. It works great for streaming videos but playing games is difficult unless the battery is fully charged. Once the battery charge gets below about 40 % the touch screen becomes erratic, for example moving, or not moving pieces when the screen is touched. No time to aim or adjust, it just fires randomly.",Slightly Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,Regret this buy. About the only thing this is good for is reading.  Battery life isn't good.  When looking at a web page cannot zoom in to see items clearer.  I wish I would have spent the extra month for a better tablet.,Slightly Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,Screen is only 6 inches not 7. Not happy it's only 6 inches,Slightly Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,"Screen is too dark for movie watching. Good for the money.  Buy it on Black Friday to get the best price. My only nitpick is that the screen is too dark for movies, even at the brightest setting.  They are hard to see. Pick something else if you want a good screen for movie watching.",Slightly Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,Screen quality. I use this mainly for reading books.  The last book I got took over 30 minutes to download and I was very close to my internet connection.  The screen keeps fading from bright to dark on its own with no interference from outside influences.,Slightly Negative

Amazon Fire Tablet,upgrade my old tablet to this new tablet. I love to read and play puzzle.  I was expecting a better upgrade but everything looks the same.  Nothing has change the looks of the tablet.  They need to redesign the looks of the tablet in home page.  I still use it to read books and puzzles.,Slightly Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,utter crap. They block you from using Google play store. Charging is slow. USB debugging doesnt give root permissions.,Slightly Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,VERY DISAPPOINTING. I was really looking forward to this tablet to read instead of my defunct Kindle.

Very disappointed to have an issue with this product right out of the package.,Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,Very happy!. Great size - got it on sale - does all I want it too.,Positive
Amazon Fire Tablet,"Was Easy on the eyes. Forces me to watch AMAZON Prime VIDEO and Alexa keeps popping up. I can not access the books that I have purchase. I've spent over $100 for books and can't even read them. Not to mention the $200 for the Fire reader. Looks like electronic waste. No help from Amazon, ever.",Slightly Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,"Was good until we plugged headphones in & realized didn't work.. Update: Headphones were not working that had a cord.

Amazon Fire Tablet,"Wonderful tablet. Had a fire 7, upgraded to the 10. No regrets screens better and runs smoother. If your debating a tablet around this price point this is your best option.",Positive
Amazon Fire Tablet,"Worst picture and color. Perhaps I got a dud but the screen was a cream color when it was supposed to be white and it was so strong that i ended up with a migraine just looking at it start up. I can't imagine reading on it which is why I bought it. And yes, I know you can adjust the brightness and go to dark mode. Not worth it.",Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,Worth every penny. Excellent tablet. I get everything I want with no trouble.,Positive
Amazon Fire Tablet,Would recommend. Excellent,Positive

Amazon Fire TV Stick,"Disappointed. Worked great for a couple months and then the remote stopped working. Tried to replace the batteries, factory reset, repair, and it still doesn’t work.

Amazon Fire TV Stick,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!. I had an older Fire Stick remote which worked great. Amazon sent me an offer to ""upgrade"" to this Alexa version. It is a total piece of garbage. It doesn't understand ANY of the requests no matter how I word them. After 15 minutes of trying, I end up finding it the old-fashioned way. Amazon should refund my money for this nonsense.",Negative

Amazon Fire TV Stick,"Does not work with the Apps and Charter Communications. Does not work with the apps and charter communications.

The Menus and Voice Interface are intuitive, easy to use, and do what you'd expect.",Slightly Positive

Anti-slip wax for glasses,"It kinda works?. This works, just not as well as i expected given the glowing reviews.  It doesn't hold my glasses in place for long but it holds them in place longer than nothing.  This is likely because the wax won't stay in place on my nose pads.  The wax keeps sliding off the pads.  Also, its a little difficult to apply.  It would benefit from a longer, narrower tube than the current design.",Slightly Negative

Coffee Filter,"Tricky install for K*Café brewer. Its tricky to install into my Keurig machine, as I do have to remove the other kcup piece to place this one.

Coffee Filter,"Work Fine. I purchased the Keurig Solo Filter Stainless Steel Mesh pods and these filters.  The filters work nicely but they are a good 1/4&#34; shorter than the pods so you don't get enough coffee in the pod for a nice &#34;potent&#34; cup.  However, they do a nice job filtering and keeping residue out of your coffee.  Just wish they were a little deeper.",Slightly Positive
Coffee Filter,"Works great with experience  and trial -error!. Well I really like it but had to experiment with different grinds. Locking fittings probably could use some beefing up as it pops open when I overfill from probable over filling going by the indicator lines, makes a mess. But with use I have had pretty good luck and can get coffee as strong as I like.",Slightly Positive

Coffee Maker,😍. Love it,Positive
Coffee Maker,"Amazing coffee. I really enjoy using the Aeropress. The coffee isn't quite as strong as espresso but it's much stronger and smoother than regular coffee. The flavor is outstanding.

Coffee Maker,"It just wasn't that great. While I enjoy coffee, I admit that I don't have the ability to discern the difference between very good and great coffee. While I'm sure the Aerobie is a great product for some, it seemed like a bit of trouble for something no better than I can do in my press. Also, it seems to take more coffee per cup than I would otherwise use, thus costing more over time.",Slightly Negative
Coffee Maker,Meh. Don’t know what all the hype is.....it makes a thimble full of coffee....pretty pricey for so little coffee. I guess if you need it for camping that’s the only thing that might make it worth it.,Slightly Negative

Coffee Maker Cups,"Useless.. Useless. The entire bottom is wire mesh and allows far too much water through.  You can hear the pressure of the water pushing through your store-bought k-cups. With these, the water just flows through freely. The coffee brewed using these is flavorless and weak. Notice your k-cups aren't surrounded with wire mesh...  truly, a useless product.",Negative

Coffee Scoop,Fussy to use. Helps keep Keurig mess manageable.,Slightly Positive
Coffee Scoop,"Great idea, but one design flaw. Nice idea, with one design flaw.  Bought it to fill the k-cup without spilling coffee grounds, however, there is a groove in the handle the same side as the fill cup, and coffee gets caught isn't here, so when I turn it to dump it into the k-cup, the coffee that got caught in the groove in the handle still spills out into the counter.",Slightly Negative
Coffee Scoop,Great little product. Takes all the mess out of refilling my k-cup. Great little product.,Positive

Coffee Scoop,"Should be a tad longer. I got this to facilitate scooping the coffee out of the bag, especially when it is getting to the bottom. I hoped the longer length would make it easier to do.  But it is a little too short. Two more inches would make it great. The problem is that when you dip all the way to the bottom the bag is deeper than the length of the scooper.

Contact Lens Solution,Don't Use if You Need Contacts Soon. It works as intended but do not listen to the directions about time.

Contact Lens Solution,Five Stars. The only cleaning solution to use!,Positive
Contact Lens Solution,"Foamed over. When I placed my contacts in the case with the cleaner all it did was foam up and over flow. I had to find an old case I had, and it didn't do that. Seems like something in the new case had a chemical reaction to the cleaner. Probably from when they made the case. Pretty irritating.",Slightly Negative
Contact Lens Solution,"Go with a smaller bottle since it's only good for 3 months. Great product, but I would go with a smaller bottle since the liquid is good for only 3 months.  I think I saw a competitors brand for under 5 at walmart.  I will have to look closer to see if its the same thing.",Slightly Negative
Contact Lens Solution,Good stuff. I think this is the best contact lens solution I've used since I haven't experienced blurry contacts or random burning when putting them on. The only problem is that it doesn't really last because you have to use so much in the case compared to others. I've only been using it for one month and i'm almost done with one bottle.,Slightly Positive

Contact Lens Solution,"OUCH! BURNS - takes more than 6 hours to neutralize. I have used this for years with no problem, but for some reason, with this last order, it burns even after 6 hours of soaking. Either I have to soak several hours longer, or switch to something that doesn't have a time requirement.",Slightly Negative
Contact Lens Solution,Really expensive. This stuff is good; it makes my contacts feel more comfortable and certainly keeps them cleaner. But this stuff is so damned expensive! It probably cost pennies to make and they run up the price because they have market share. With the way you have to use the product you run out of it super quickly and realize you've just blown $15 on a few weeks worth of contact cleaner. Crazy!,Slightly Negative
Contact Lens Solution,They reduced the bottle size. Just another company that decided to shrink their product. It is  a shameful<br />and shady practice. Bottles are much smaller comparing to just a few months ago.,Slightly Negative
Contact Lens Solution,"User for 2 decades. I've been wearing contact lenses since 1973.  This product works better than anything I've ever tried, particularly when your lenses are grimy from pollution and irritants.  The generics are fine, but the Alcon brand is really the best.",Positive

Cotton Rounds,Not great. They shed bad.. These shed when you use them.,Slightly Negative
Cotton Rounds,"Not really textured, as expected. Ordered these because they were to be textured cotton rounds, making eye makeup remove easier and more completely.

Cotton Rounds,Not recommend. It's not well made. The little cotton fly aways will get everywhere on your finger and face,Slightly Negative
Cotton Rounds,Not so great. Just ok . I use cotton rounds everyday.  I I’m going to have to find a better brand that has more of a quilted side the quilted side gets down deeper to takeoff makeup with toner t Takes of nail polish well I also use these for applying alcohol.

Cotton Rounds,Very thin. Very thin and is made cheap.. I have to use two at a time or else it's too thin and just absorbs everything and I can't even sweep it across my face.,Slightly Negative
Cotton Rounds,"You get your money's worth. These rub my eyes in the bad way. They're really rough, and really not that thick. I think you get what you pay for in terms of these. Obviously they still do their job, but I really wish they were softer because I feel like I'm probably getting scratches on my skin even with it soaking wet.",Slightly Negative
Cotton Rounds,You’ll not save your money. Good price for 4 packs. But I would like to see better quality for this price. Sometimes it feels like a little rough. The rounds are too thin and you’ll need to use more. I think it’s not worth it because you can buy more expensive one and you’ll use it same time like this one.,Slightly Negative

Curling Brush / Iron,Did not like. Didn’t work for me.,Slightly Negative
Curling Brush / Iron,"died after 6 months. was good until it stopped working.  Used every day, and stopped working after 6 months.  Lights up, but does not get hot.  For the price, should last longer than that.",Slightly Negative
Curling Brush / Iron,"Does a good job. This curling brush does what I had expected.  It is very hard to find a curling brush in the one inch size.  My only complaint is that the bristles are a little sharp on my scalp.  If they were more rounded, I would have given it 5 stars.",Slightly Positive
Curling Brush / Iron,For shorter hair that needs curl. Works great for short straight hair that needs curl or body.  It does  not slip off the roller.  Works well for me.,Positive
Curling Brush / Iron,Forever to heat up. Not really what I expected as far as heat up time and it just didn’t really give my hair the look I wanted. I think it just doesn’t get hot enough.,Slightly Negative

Curling Brush / Iron,I do not recommend it. I am disappointed in it.  I have a Conair bristle brush that works very well but it is larger.  My hair is short and coarse so I thought the 1/2 inch brush would do well.  There do not seem to be enough bristles on the brush to grab hair.  I do not recommend it.,Negative
Curling Brush / Iron,It is my favorite curling iron except the fact that it does not .... It is my favorite curling iron except the fact that it does not always last very long.  The inside wlll strip out over tme and then the barrel spins.,Slightly Negative
Curling Brush / Iron,"Love the hard-to-find 1 1/2"" barrel. The one I'd been using for 15+ years finally died & this is a replacement.  Prefer the old design to this newer design, but it may be a matter of getting used to it.  Would be a good hair day without this brush iron!",Slightly Positive
Curling Brush / Iron,"Needs longer spikes.. Being a hairdresser, I have used curling irons for years.  This one was okay but I have come close to burning my fingers and face a few times.  If the spikes were longer it would grab the hair easier and not need your hand to hold your hair around the barrel.  Longer spikes and more narrow spaces between them would also prevent accidental burns to your face.",Slightly Negative
Curling Brush / Iron,"Not effective, curls don't last. I have several hot brushes, but most are hot air.  I wanted to try this concept for quick style touchups.  It doesn't work nearly as well as the hot air brushes, doesn't get that hot, and the styling doesn't last for me--and my hair curls quite easily.  I just don't use it, but always go back to my old hot air brush.",Negative

Dietary Supplement,Fish Oil. Its really good i am using every day good for health,Positive
Dietary Supplement,Fishy taste. This product came highly recommended. I keep it in the fridge but still has a strong fish taste.

Dietary Supplement,Five Stars. This is the best Fish Oil you can get and I love it!,Positive
Dietary Supplement,Goes great in your coffee!!. Yum!! This tastes so good in your coffee mixed with a hint of chocolate... Just like an Almond Joy candy bar!! I only docked 1 star because it’s a bit pricey for such a small bag. Tastes good though!,Slightly Positive

Dietary Supplement,"Great supplement for omega,  taste is good 👍,  I will be ordering again 😋. The none fishy taste of this .",Positive
Dietary Supplement,Hard to get it out.. This product is difficult to get out of the container.  They provide you with a very small measuring spoon for the product.  Trying to dig my big hand down into the bottom of the bag is difficult.  I will jot buy the product in this container again.  I have not noticed any difference in my body from taking g the product.,Slightly Negative
Dietary Supplement,hate the lemon!. I was looking for a liquid omega-3 fish oil to add to my vitamix blast each morning. I had been just emptying gel tabs into it and thought it would be wiser to simply get a bottle.<br /><br />I do not like the lemon additive. It is really gross and overpowering. I guess I will try and find one with the added flavor.,Slightly Negative

I like this particular product because it's organic and sourced from whole food. I highly recommend it.",Positive
Dietary Supplement,"Nasty, terrible, disgusting and salty!!! Stay away. Disgusting!!! It’s super salty and ruined an entire fruit smoothie I added it to. I even threw up from the taste. I have had Irish Sea moss before and put it in my smoothies no problem but this one is just nasty and terrible!!!!",Negative
Dietary Supplement,Nice Product!. I bought this product because I read in a periodical that Omega 3's are what we need for inflamation.  It's better than Omega 6's.  So I switched over to this Fish Oil product and I'm enjoying the lemon taste.  I take two teaspoons a day and the taste is not offensive at all.  I will order another when this one runs out and hopefully my body will do much better in the future.,Positive
Dietary Supplement,"Not what I thought. Terrible flavor.. Yuck!  I have tried beet juice powder in the past and it was great, but this is beet root powder.  I did not catch the distinction when ordering, but it makes all the difference in the world with flavor.  I am sure this will be effective at bolstering hemoglobin levels if you can get past the taste.",Slightly Negative
Dietary Supplement,"Other ingredients than just coconut milk.. I know pure coconut milk tends to clump, but I would rather have clumping than have other ingredients included to prevent clumping. My body doesn't like the starches added. It adulterates the taste as well.",Slightly Negative
Dietary Supplement,Perfect for me. Love this for my bowels and headaches!,Positive
Dietary Supplement,"Pretty good supplement powder. Spirulina powder is kind of one of those trendy health supplements right now, so I'm not surprised by the price, especially for an organic product.<br /><br />Easy to add into green smoothies and such, if you don't put a crazy amount, the flavor is pretty easily hidden, not bad!",Slightly Positive
Dietary Supplement,"Product works. Let's just say....it work. For everything that Magnesium is needed for, it works. Especially since it's in a higher dose form. We're already all so deficient in it, might as well get a higher dose.",Positive
Dietary Supplement,"Quality. I have been taking this product for years.  But my two last orders were not the same as before. It use to have rather thick consistency of oil when refrigerated as instructed.  But the last two even though they were refrigerated, pours out like water!.  I don't know why everything has to change.  No need to cheap it. Keep the good quality and charge more.  My health is more important.",Slightly Negative
Dietary Supplement,"Strong Fish Oil. Seemed to be very pure, I have no way to measure that fact. It had an alright clean lemon taste, but your still drinking oil and you can tell.",Slightly Positive
Dietary Supplement,Superfood Maca Powder. Maca Powder is a superfood from Peru. You can mix some of the powder in your smoothies and you can also add some to your baking. It is good for giving you endurance. It is very nutritious but also has 20 grams of carbohydrates per serving.,Slightly Positive

Dietary Supplement,This is not a 6 pack like it's listed. So it is quite expensive for 8oz.. Not 6 pack.  You get 1.,Slightly Negative

Dishwasher Magnet,Adhesive not too strong. Looks okay when display. A little too big. The adhesive not too strong,Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,"CAUTION could cause rusting. I’m giving it three stars because after removing it to clean our Bosche dishwasher, we noticed rust spots starting to form, obviously moisture accumulates behind it.<br />We stopped using it.",Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,"Clean or dirty ?. I like that this sign is large and adhesive since we can’t use a magnetic sign, however, it slides away from what we set it which isn’t good.",Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,Could be better. Brand name is printed on sliding cover.  Kinda ruins it.  No complaints other than that.,Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,"Damaged my new stainless steel dishwasher.. The seller advises “In inbuilt Industrial magnets are covered by soft silica to protect dishwasher.  After a few weeks of use,  I took the product off my dishwasher.  The magnet  rusted through and left rust on my new  stainless steel Dishwasher . The  dishwasher is now damaged.",Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,Delicate. We had a different one that just completely disappeared. Bought this one and was satisfied with it until I watched my cat lay his declawed paws on it and it fell apart. 😕,Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,"Dishwasher note. Liked it so much, ordered a second one for son",Positive
Dishwasher Magnet,"Doesn't stay. It sticks well onto the dishwasher, but the sign does NOT stay put. It moves quite easily.  If I pay $7 for a piece of plastic, I expect it to do its one function very well. Not so much. I'm disappointed.",Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,"Doesn’t stay in place. This is not a bad little sign, my only complaint, which will probably make me replace it is it doesn’t stay in place.  If someone, or my dog, brushes up against the sign it slides to the middle or other side.  It really should snap or lock into place.",Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,"Doesn’t work believe it or not:-). Door slides too easy, the vibration from the dishwasher causes the door to move thus making it useless.<br />Looks pretty but not functional.",Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,Easy peasy. Easily stays on dishwasher and doesn’t move when I slide to change the status.,Positive

Dishwasher Magnet,Excellent. Sticks to the dishwasher and easy to slide.,Positive
Dishwasher Magnet,"Family Doesn't Understand.... I got this as every time I do dishes and clean the sink out, I thought it would be easier for my family to see whats up with the dishwasher.

If it only came with a family training guide....",Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,Great addition to litchen. Easy now to know if dishes are dirty or clean,Positive
Dishwasher Magnet,"Great magnet. Love this.  Our flip magnet lost the magnet from constant taking on and off to flip clean/dirty to the top.  This won't be a problem with this one. Kids like it because it's clear which one is ""designated"". No need for stickies magnet works great.",Positive
Dishwasher Magnet,Great when you have kids. Exactly what I was looking for. Very useful for the kids.,Positive
Dishwasher Magnet,Impressed. I am very happy. It looks even better than the picture!,Positive
Dishwasher Magnet,It helped!. It became a joke that my husband would only put dirty dishes in the dishwasher when it was clean.  Then we had to figure out which ones he put in.  I decided we needed to get a dirty/clean sign and this one works perfectly.  He went to put dirty dishes in the dishwasher and noticed the sign said CLEAN! Hurray! lol,Positive
Dishwasher Magnet,"It will do the job. I was expecting a magnetic product but failed to realize this is herod l held on by two adhesive pads. Each pass is nickel sized and has ashtrays adhesive on two sides. So far it has held up well and when the person who runs the dishwasher remembers to change it, it works well.",Slightly Positive

Dishwasher Magnet,Magnet Too Weak. The magnet is too weak to keep the product in place as you move the slider from Dirty/Clean.,Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,"Magnetic. Easy to read.. Magnetic and sticks to my dishwasher well. Easy to read. Before I had the sign that you flipped over, and it kept getting knocked off. This is working much better for us.",Positive
Dishwasher Magnet,"Melted to the dishwasher.... I loved this thing until today when I realized that it melted to the dishwasher. If you get it, make sure to move it around or not do two loads of dishes in a row because apparently it’ll melt? Not really sure when this happened since I have it in the same place all the time. We’re renting this apartment and the melted plastic isn’t coming off easily, so beware.",Slightly Negative

Earbuds,By far the best. So much better than the Apple headphones and I was pleasantly surprised. Great value for the money and the charge lasts a long time!,Positive
Earbuds,"Cheap and ""OK"". These are kind of fragile, but work. Bass isn't good, not the greatest sound replication, but for the price there's no complaining. Except I also bought a pair off Amazon that cost a whopping $3 and they work the same. Same sound, same quality. Skullcandy is the one to beat, but I don't like using those where they might get wet or destroyed.",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,color was slightly different than in the picture. pretty good,Slightly Positive
Earbuds,Decent audio with convenient charging.. Decent audio but not great for critical listening. They aren't noise canceling and they don't isolate much better than any rubber buds. I enjoy the battery life and case with extra battery. Also the wireless charging.,Slightly Positive
Earbuds,"Decent headphones. I got these to listen to music through my laptop. I'm no expert but they're decent headphones, good sound, nothing special. The thin wire makes them feel cheap and the kinks in the wire from being wrapped up inside the packaging feel like they'll never go away. The wire also gets a lot of knots and tangles.",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,"didn't know what equipment was needed to use wireless. I'm sure I would have loved the earphones.  My tv did not have blue tooth.

I still think the sound quality, volume, and charge on both case and earbuds are fantastic but I'm on my second pair, after one of the buds died after ~6 months, and now one of the buds has again gone almost completely silent after less than 2 months. Pretty disappointed",Slightly Negative

Earbuds,Headset. It ok but they kept coming out of my ears,Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Heavy. The earphones won’t stay in my ears no matter which ear bud size I use - they are too heavy and fall out if I move my head.  Every time I touch them at all I seem to accidentally skip or pause my music as well.  The sound quality seems good when they’re in & the battery life seems to be very good.  I rarely use them though because they fall out too much.,Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Hgreat earbuds. Work amazing more then 8 hours play time.,Positive

Earbuds,"Poor mic. If you received/dialled a call using phone directly, and switched to this Bluetooth device after 10 seconds of conversation, person at other end will hear you okay. But if you do the same in Bluetooth mode, the person at the other end will not hear your voice.",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Pretty good for the price. My main complaints - I have a hard time pulling these guys out of the charging case. And they aren't as comfortable as I would like. For 30 bucks they are pretty good and I would buy them again.,Slightly Positive
Earbuds,Randomly disconnects. Randomly disconnects.,Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Seem to work OK. Like them so far. I find the volume controls a bit awkward,Slightly Positive
Earbuds,"Sent wrong color!. Used to purchase these a lot and I needed another pair. Good for the price. However, these are CLEARLY not metallic. They are glossy. Disappointed!",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Sound is great but mic didnt work at all.. I was so happy to get these headphones and today I used it on my first conference but my mic didnt work correctly at all. I should have gotten the regular ones without the mic. But I cant return it now because I threw the box out.<br /><br />$22 down the drain. I can't believe that. Just get the ones without the mic.,Slightly Negative
Earbuds,These do not stay in your ears!. Absolutely impossible to use. There is no way to make them stay in your ears,Negative
Earbuds,"They're ""OK"". They're OK. Sometimes they fade one and out, well alot.",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Three Stars. Pretty good basic headphones.,Slightly Positive
Earbuds,totally worthless. there was no battery. I had trouble putting on a smaller ear piece so they would fit in my ears. I finally did that but it did not cancel out any noise and I could not hear anything out of one earpiece.  I am stuck with them because the company won't take them back.  DO NOT BUY!!!!,Negative
Earbuds,"Two Stars. Good price and good fit, but sound quality is poor.",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Uncomfortable. Uncomfortable,Slightly Negative
Earbuds,"Used 4 times, right stopped working. Wife was past return time before she started using them, after about 4 uses the right ear piece stopped working. Make sure to try them a few times as soon as you get them!",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Value for money. I use these to do virtual exercise classes as well as to listen to music on my iPhone. They work perfectly!,Positive
Earbuds,Very good buy!!!. I like this product. The voice notification is surprisingly refreshing. The sound is rich. Cons very difficult to open opening for charging and to remove buds. I will be buying the quick charger so that I won't eventually break the door for charging port.,Slightly Positive
Earbuds,Warning. Speakers do not play at the same volume. Who knows how long they will even last if they come out of the box like that,Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Won't fit my ears no matter what. The battery life is great but I spent more time picking up the ears pieces than listening<br />They are bulky heavy and I tried the other extensions but they still falling down,Slightly Negative
Earbuds,"Worked great initially, left earbud went out after 6 weeks.. These Worked amazing initially, however, the downside was battery life was only about 3 hours. Sound quality was great! Comfortable to wear. Then 6 weeks after use, the left ear bud went out. I am outside the 30 day return, so i don’t feel the money is worth the product.",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,"Worked up to the warranty period!. I bought these as started earbuds for myself. I often lose them so I didn’t want to have to replace 150 dollar earbuds. They were working just fine until the warranty date passed. Now, I’m stuck with only a right earbud because the left refuses to charge or connect.",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Worth the price. Can’t complain about these. Well worth the price. Better than average sound.,Positive
Earbuds,You won't go wrong with these. I love these earbuds. Incredible sound.,Positive
Earplugs,"Clear sound yet protective. Used them at band rehearsal.  Wow, the sound was clear but at a reduced volume. So many plugs muffle or modulate the sound to the point where the music is not listenable. So far, these help to reduce the ringing in your ears. They also make a long stem version making it easier to remove. This version in not detectable,  very discrete. Go ahead, protect your ears!",Positive
Earplugs,"Dangerously small.  Gets stuck in the ear.. The first time I put this in my ear, it turned around sideways and got stuck in my ear canal and I had to use an object to fish the ear plug out of my ear, which was very awkward.<br /><br />I've been using various ear plus for over 20 years without issues, so doubt this was user error.  These ear plugs are far too small for an adult to use safely.",Negative
Earplugs,Disappointed. These pieces are too small for me and had an awkward time placing them in my ear.  Love the the lil carry canister though,Slightly Negative
Earplugs,"Don't hesitate to buy. It really does help you hear others while at a concert, and still blocks the noise. I was skeptical, but they are pretty awesome.",Positive
Earplugs,"Five Stars. For the price, these earplugs can't be beat.",Positive
Earplugs,Five Stars. I can sleep!!,Positive
Earplugs,Five Stars. Thanks!,Positive
Earplugs,"For small ear. If you have small ears this product will work for you,  I bought these for me but ended up given them to my wife they don't fit my ears to small for me!",Slightly Negative
Earplugs,"Great fit. These fit very well. They do reduce noise, but also muffles sounds you want to hear. Definitely just a reduction, not full hearing protection.",Slightly Positive
Earplugs,I bought the short handle ones and wish I had .... I bought the short handle ones and wish I had the longer handle ones.  (It is a learning curve to get them into the ear correctly) A friend has a longer handle pair and she finds them so much easier to place in her ears and actually you can't see them in her ear. I wish I had the longer handle ones.<br />The case is an extra plus.,Slightly Negative
Earplugs,"I'll bet they work really well for some people. I'm sorry but I just could't manage to make this fit in my ear well enough to block sound as designed, despite repeated attempts.",Slightly Negative
Earplugs,"If anyone has found great plugs for concerts please post. Ear plugs did not fit well, caused vibration in my ear canal and were generally disappointing. Did not seem to lower the volume as I had hoped.<br />If anyone has found great plugs for concerts please post.",Slightly Negative
Earplugs,Junk.. Junk. Doesn't block out any noise.,Slightly Negative
Earplugs,"Meh - Not much different from a foam plug.. I used these at a concert where I knew there would be a lot of loud people. They did ok, but the quality of the music suffered. It more muffled the sound that rurning it down. Realy comfortable and easy to insert. Probably would try another brand if I was going to use again.",Slightly Negative
Earplugs,Nice try though. I can still hear everything.  EVERYTHING. Every snore. Every teeth grind.,Slightly Negative
Earplugs,ok. They were OK but lost them easily since they are so small (Be sure to use the little case),Slightly Negative
Earplugs,"Scared the crap out of me. Scared the crap out of me!. Put them in to try them out, went to pull them out by the stem like normal and the stem came off with the plug still in my ear. Luckily I got some tweezers and got them out..... not a well thought out design.",Slightly Negative
Earplugs,stems are too small and make it hard to retrieve .... stems are too small and make it hard to retrieve the ear plugs from your ear canal if you need to push them in,Slightly Negative
Earplugs,"These are great, discreet. I wish I had started wearing ear protection to raves sooner! These are great, discreet, and comfortable. They block out the crappy noise and I can hear.my boyfriend talk without him having to scream in my ear. The first time I was the only one wearing them, I could hear him but he couldn't hear me. I let him try them and he was impressed. We bought him his own pair.",Positive
Earplugs,"These plugs didn't provide satisfactory sound. Although these ear plugs are comfortable and did reduce the volume of the concert, to me they also made the music sound off a bit, contrary to the company's claim. Note, however, that a woman of my acquaintance thought they did a great job in my living room with music played at high volume.",Slightly Negative
Earplugs,They work great. I bought these for a concert and they work great without making the sound feel muffled too much,Positive
Earplugs,We use these in the Jazz clubs to tone down .... We use these in the Jazz clubs to tone down enthusiastic players.  Don't take them to the gun range and expect any kind of protection.  That's not their intention.,Slightly Positive
Earplugs,"Work as advertised! I do a lot of parties .... Work as advertised! I do a lot of parties, and always have years. This helps extremely well. If you want to be able to still hear people in the music, this product is for you.",Positive

Echo Dot,Alexa has problems understanding at times.. Alexa has problems understanding may times. We have names for lights etc. Sometimes we have to repeat the name several times before alexa understands. Sometimes I think alexa is getting tired of my voice and ignores me like my wife.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Alexa I love you. Just get it. Live in the new wave!,Positive
Echo Dot,"Alexa, acts like she can’t hear.. I like the 3rd Generation way better! I have to say Alexa wayyyy too many times with this one. It’s a pain. Lord forbid im in the shower and want to play the next song, I have to practically scream. Overall wouldn’t recommend the 4th. The 3rd is much better quality and sound.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Alexa. I love this!!!!!!!,Positive
Echo Dot,Amazing: But isn't a bluetooth speaker like the 1st Gen. Does not play music via blue tooth from a mobile device. The first generation Dot plays music via blue tooth from our phones just fine. This one does not.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Awesome product..A+++. Awesome product..my fiance loved her birthday present,Positive
Echo Dot,AWESOME. a friend told me he had this and it was great  .. ive been looking at it and looking at it .. and he convinced me i needed it  ... alexa is pretty funny at times ...  i saw that angel stand for it  .. i wish they had more choices  ... nothing caught my eye  maybe someday one will,Positive
Echo Dot,Broken after 7months. It says it’s connected to WiFi. Then the other screen says disconnected. Is it broken?,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Can not control volume. Volume is disappointing LOW and I can not raise it any higher. If I would have known I would not have bought it.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Can't answer most of my questions.. Very dumb due to bad programming.  Can't answer most of my questions.  Typical have to ask Google on my phone, which almost always knows.  Most of the skills you can load are bad and a waste of time.  Nice for music (although speaker not good.  Later models supposed to be better.) and controlling linked devices.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Can't get the app needed to use the dot to download. I can't get the app needed to activate my dot to download from play store. Has anyone else had problems downloading the app? If you did and figured out the problem please let us who can't get the alexa app downloaded know what we should do. Thank you for any help.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Can’t play. I am hooked to Wi-Fi and still won’t play,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Cool but nothing to write home about. There is a coolness factor but she loses connection all the time and really doesn't do it anything besides try to get me to subscribe to more services.<br />Not next happy with her.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Devices DO NOT sync. I LOVE Alexa - I bought Echo so I could have Alexa in multiple rooms but what good is the DOT if you can't sync it with Alexa so they are playing the same thing in multiple rooms.  Very disappointed I should have read further before buying! Hope they come up with a feature to sync them.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Do Not Buy. It use to be a good system. As of 9/30/2020 it has gone into the pot. This has been going on for days now. At times it works. Most of the time it does not. Not a good situation for an elderly home counting on voice activation. If you want a new toy that tells you stupid jokes, it is a good product.",Negative
Echo Dot,"Doesn't always understand. Works well with our thermostat and one outlet, doesn't always understand your questions or misunderstands what you say",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Doesn't compare to Alexa quality and ease of operation.. Wife in nursing home. To listen to her fav songs.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Doesn't sync with my Windows phone. We're still getting to know each other. I can't get schedule reminders, or Bluetooth syncs. What's funny is if the tv is on and &#34;she&#34; hears her name &#34;she&#34; perks up. Don't let an Alexa commercial come on... too funny.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Doesn't synch with Amazon Fire TV, or iPad. I was hoping it would synch to my amazon Fire TV products, as well as my iPad, but no such luck.  For now, We use it for music.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Doesn't work well with firetv. Can't power off a fire tv with a routine. Absolutely dumb.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Don't expect to get a white cord with the white Echo Dot. White Echo came with a black cord and plug - why can't Amazon color coordinate their electronics!!!,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Echo Dot is garbage! I hate it!. Echo dot is trash. Any variation in wifi and the thing will never work again.  The stupid thing will keep repeating go to app, go to app, go to app.  Got me so angry that I smashed the dot on the ground.  Siri is 100 times better!!!",Negative
Echo Dot,ECHO Dot. Love it!,Positive
Echo Dot,"Eh, I should have just gotten another Echo. The sound quality is lacking.. The sound is not at all like the Echo.  I am still on the fence if I want to return it and just buy another echo because of the sound quality.  It works for having an &#34;extension&#34; for your Echo to add things to your list(s), playing your music etc.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Excellent Product. Fantastic little speaker with quality sound and Alexa voice controls,Positive
Echo Dot,extremely simple to get alexa and smart bulb and plug in  took maybe 5 mins. no problems  works well with my prime and roku also,Positive
Echo Dot,"fantastic product. this is honestly my first time knowing about echo products and this speaker exceeds all of my needs. the music sounds great. jazz sounds great, gospel music sounds great, R&B sounds fantastic… you won’t be disappointed.",Positive

Echo Dot,Good Toy. Sound quality is terrible Fun toy!,Slightly Positive
Echo Dot,"Great addition to my listening enjoyment. Works great, easy set up.",Positive
Echo Dot,"Great deal for the money. I got this dot for our garage.  I like that it functions like the original Echo I have in the house, but the sound quality isn't even close. I'll be purchasing a surround sound system to attach to this to see if that does the trick.  For the price I got this, I'm very happy with it.",Slightly Positive
Echo Dot,Great speaker; a perfect gift!. Too fun - great speaker! I slipped mine inside a vintage radio.<br />It adds my shopping list to my iPhone and plays Jazz while I do housework. LOVE IT!!,Positive
Echo Dot,"Great!. Great little speaker. Alexa is helpful with handsfree. I use it currently in our daughters nursery for night time music. The wifi could be better, the device has froze up a couple of times where I had to restart it. Once when I playing my  music on it.",Slightly Positive
Echo Dot,"Horrible connection issues. It worked well for a few weeks then it's been plagued with connection issues, it goes offline and takes a lot of time to unpair/reset/repair and try to connect again every couple of days, it's not a WiFi issue because I have other smart speakers that haven't been disconnected for about a year, they really need to improve the quality of these things.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"I am learning. The Dot was a gift to me.  I have just begun with her.<br />My vision is very limited and I can now listen to my Audible books easily, adjust the volume, pause and start again at my convenience.<br />That is so wonderful and I will be exploring more of what Alexia has to offewr.<br />She does answer almost any question I can think of!",Positive
Echo Dot,I don't feel comfortable having something recording everything that is said. She listens to everything she starts talking when I have the TV on.  I don't feel comfortable having something recording everything that is said.  She's only supposed to respond when you call her name.  It proves you have no privacy if you use this thing. .  She is unhooked and sent back,Negative
Echo Dot,I found it good for lazy persons. I hate gadgets so stuff like this bores me. Got it as gift and initially used to play music. Music quality is crap. Voice recognition is poor. Will probably regift it for my lazy inlaws,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,I love it to listen to music (you have to pay .... I love it to listen to music (you have to pay a monthly  charge) and to ask about the weather and some questions but I haven't figured out much more it can do??,Slightly Positive
Echo Dot,I love it! Being able to use handsfree voice commands .... I love it! Being able to use handsfree voice commands to obtain info and listen to music I to which wouldn't normally  have access is great. Amazing what this little hockey puck can do! :),Positive
Echo Dot,"I Love My Echo. It was easy to set up and she responds quickly to my voice.  I did not know she can find books on Audible so I get to listen to books on tape which is awesome.  She responds to my friends' voices as well without hesitation.  I use Alexa to play rain sounds as I try to go to sleep....pretty awesome.  Love, Love, Love it!",Positive
Echo Dot,I mostly use it as voice-activated light switch.. I got this with my smart lightbulb. I've enjoyed it a great deal. It was very easy to set up.,Positive

Echo Dot,"It's good and all but.... It doesn't seem very useful to me, maybe I'm not the targeted audience for this device. It's quite smart though that's all i have to say. Also i did not buy it i received it as a random gift at a Christmas office luncheon.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,It's good but 3rd generation is my fave...more bass. If you like bass ...3rd generation is it!,Slightly Positive
Echo Dot,It's good. I like this item for helping. What I dislike is the fact it responses to everything. Without even saying it's name sometimes.,Slightly Positive
Echo Dot,Love. Love,Positive
Echo Dot,Meh. Doesn't work like the 3rd generation,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Not as good as the previous versions. The sound is too bassy, despite accessing the equalizer. Makes it hard to understand Alexa.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Not what i wantef. I have a son with speech impediment. Didn't pick him up at al,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,OK but need good internet. Big Brother listening. Hard to get them each to work. Bought a few. But don't need Big Brother listening in. Crappy internet here so barely would work.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Otherwise happy with it. Sometimes seems to have trouble hearing you when you say &#34;echo&#34;, causing you to have to repeat yourself. Otherwise happy with it. I like that it comes in the while color. Goes nice in the kitchen.",Slightly Positive
Echo Dot,"Perfect gift!. Bought them for kids, they lived them!",Positive
Echo Dot,"Poor sound quality. Very poor sound quality. If I could return it, I would.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Pure trash. A terrible device. Pay walls for a lot of things like music even though I have prime.<br /><br />It can't understand most requests. Do not buy it.,Negative
Echo Dot,Reminders to take my medication!. We love ours! I like it when I say Alexa tell me a dirty joke!! Too funny!,Positive
Echo Dot,RETURN. RETURN,Negative
Echo Dot,Sad. Hardly recognizes what I ask for... Only good for telling jokes and the weather.  Other then that don't bother.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Seriously makes life more enjoyable. I purchased the Echo Dot 2 after hearing about it over a dinner with friends. My main reason was for using it as a speaker, but have found the alarm and reminder system so helpful. Even the games are enjoyable.",Positive
Echo Dot,Slow connecting. Love the idea BUT it is slow to receive directions. Sometimes no response at all except blue ring circling. And when it is on it DROPS sound  just like our cell phones used to do years ago. Sound  quality Great  when it is finally connected.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Small nice device. But have security concerns. Makes a weird noise a few times a day. Big brother listening?,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Sometimes doesn't know the answers. I got two Echo dots as a gift. I don't use them very much I did set them up but sometimes I asked questions and either she doesn't understand or she doesn't know the answer very often I don't really know what to say about how much I like her it's okay but it's not something that I would have bought for myself,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Sound quality is crap. I guess it does what is supposed to but sound quality is not good so I rarely use it. It’s okay for speech but listening to music is painful.<br /><br />I prefer Googles assistant. I was worth a try.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Sound quality is poor. I returned it because the older generation sounded better. I tried this to see if it is an improvement - it is not. Do not buy. You’ll regret it. No bass sound.,Negative
Echo Dot,"Terrible sound quality. So I have several large speaker Alexa devices, but due to scalpers, those aren't available currently. So I bought this instead. The sound quality is crackly and awful. It's not very loud either. The sound is very tinny and just sounds bad. Anyway, it was only $20 so I'm not too mad about it.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"They become less responsive over time.. They're ok, but I'm upgrading to Sonos.  Decent if you have a small place and are concerned about being considerate towards your neighbors.",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Very Annoying!. This system is very limited. The sole aim appears to be to tempt you into laying your life bare for technology to prey on.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Very useful.. I enjoy having Alexa in almost every room so I can listen to my favorite radio and TV stations.  I've been using it as an intercom, too, so I can call my husband instead of shouting or walking to the other end of the house.  We've also gotten used to asking Alexa all kinds of questions...most of which get answered.",Positive
Echo Dot,"When you can get for a low price, they are a good buy. Alexa is so dumb some days, but we use it for simple things and like it",Slightly Positive
Echo Dot,"White cord?. I enjoy the electronics part, but why do you make a black product with a white power cord?<br /><br />Makes no sense",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,White Cord. Not happy that the cord does not match my machine.  If I had known it was going to be white I would not have chosen black.  I may return this item just for this reason.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Wish it was recharable so I could take it outside with us  but great speakers is a plus!!. Love the clear volume!,Slightly Positive
Echo Dot,Wish it worked better. A little disappointed. She understands a lot but she also says she can't find whatever I'm asking her to lookup quiet a bit.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Wish!. I wish that it didn't have to be plugged in so thatcwe could use it on the deck!  Also, I wish it would play music louder- for parties etc!  I have the larger one for living area!  I would have purchased one or 2 more if they were louder- & not plug ins!",Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,Works great!. Works great!,Positive
Echo Dot,Worth the extra money. The sound quality is so much better than the other Echo dots even the Echo Show I have. The speakers are a lot nicer. I got it when it was a special that the colored light bulb came with it. My daughter loves the light bulb. She loves how it changes colors and the whole room changes that color. It is nice how Alexa will turn the light one when asked.,Positive
Echo Dot,You’ll never regret having it in your life!!. This  Echo Dot was a gift from my son to help me navigate new technology.  BEST GIFT EVER!  How did I ever live without it!!,Positive

Exfoliating Cloth,"a little rough for me. the cloth is huge, and a little rough for my skin",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"AHHH.  INGENIOUS PRODUCT. Excellent product.  Body wash works great with these, you no longer need a wash cloth, or back scrubber.  We wash ours in the washer with the towels and hang to dry.  Last forever.",Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"Best Wash Cloth. Best bathing cloth ever.  This is such a satisfying exfoliating cloth, and is the perfect size.  You will need much less soap to get a great lather from these.",Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"but good product. I normally use straight sugar. Not as rough as I expected, but good product. I normally use straight sugar, so I like a very rough exfoliation.",Slightly Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"Exfoliate your tucass off!. Been using these now for over 6 years, no change in quality at all, just price. As with everything with this lousy economy and high inflation, this is to be expected..... Unfortunately. But the product rocks. Head to toe exfoliation with every shower!",Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,Five Stars. Perfect bandannas for when im out doing outdoorsy stuff.,Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,Get a great shower!. These are awesome! I'm glad to have discovered them.,Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"Great Texture, Awkward Size. These clothes are great to use, but huge and impractical. I tried cutting one into 3 pieces for more manageable use, and the cut end started fraying badly, which is what I suspected would happen. So I am having a friend cut and sew the ends of the remaining two towels into something more wash-cloth sized.",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"Hard to Use. I was really excited to try this but I found it hard to use.  The cloth is very long and even when I bunch it up I feel like I am not able to easily scrub my skin.  It tends to slide around under my hand but not on my skin. I tried cutting it up but had the same problem.  It also frays if you cut it up. Oh well, at least it wasn't expensive.",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,Highly Recommend. I’ve been using this for years! It exfoliates my skin gently and feels super clean.,Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"If you like them rough. they are extremely scratchy and rough.  I was looking for something a little softer.  If you like them rough, then you'll like these.",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"it feels like it is exfoliating. Because of the roughness, it feels like it is exfoliating.  But I noticed when I am removing self tanner after a few days - it does nothing.  Yet, I can use a wet facecloth and take off all the self tanner without a problem.  And the tanner is just on the outer layer of dead skin, which I assume is coming off with the facecloth.",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"It’s a washcloth but Wow!. I love this. Also gave  one to each daughter as a stocking stuffer and they love them too. It’s so long that you can wash your whole back. Love the perfect level of friction. Great exfoliation. The ones we got were from Japan, not China.",Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"knockoff. I've been using this all my life, bought them from asian markets, and was happy to find a good price on Amazon. I just opened and used it and it's not the same as the one they sell at Asian markets. This is much softer knock off version. Original one scrubs the shi* out of you, which is what I like about it.",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,Love them. Love them,Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,Love these towels. These towels are awesome. They exfoliate and clean your body/skin like no other. Excellent quality and they last forever. You will never use a washcloth again,Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,Nice for cleaning your back.. work well and not real rough.,Slightly Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"Not as good as I hoped. Years ago I got a similar product from qvc. It was thinner, but with the same texture -- just not as rough. I mistakenly thought this was the same thing. If you have sensitive skin, this is not a good idea.",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"Not for humans. I find it insanely rough, like rubbing my skin with coarse sand paper. I might use it on a rhinoceros, but not on a human. Yes, I lathered it up as recommended. Painful! Where I used it on my forearm the skin appears to have developed a rash. At my house this product is headed for the trash.",Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"Not for me. I didn't care for them at all.  I'm sure it does remove dead skin cells, and maybe that is all I should have expected, but I found them uncomfortable to use.  I used one once and put them away.  I think I will use them to clean the sink area.",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,Not impressed. Doesn't seem to give more lather like the claim it feel any better than a loofah,Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,Not my thing. To bulky. Wish I hadn't bothered. But probably fits the purpose. My own fault for buying - no real purpose in my world. A little too rough for me to exfoliate.,Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,Not the fabric I expected. Rough netting like.. I do not like the texture or feel of this on my skin.,Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,Not what I expected to receive.... Too rough and flimsy.,Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"Not what I thought.... These are much rougher than I thought they would be.  They feel more like the material of a loofah than an exfoliating wash cloth.  I would never use these on my face, but they might come in handy for your feet (they are that rough).",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"One Star. this is not the genuine product, I used this product for a long time it is not the same.",Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,Pretty rough on the skin. These were a lot rougher than I was expecting.  Might work for some people but it hurt too much for me.,Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"Salux Wathclothes. Love these! The bumps on my legs finally gone! I just use on my arms on legs. Also, a great gift for girlfriends!",Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"The Real Deal Salux.... After some hit or miss orders of this item in the past, I recently ordered from 'JapanSuperMall' fulfilled by Amazon and these are the real deal, authentic Salux beauty skin cloths.  They are the 'harsher' authentic ones not the softer knock offs.",Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"They're durable, they exfoliate my skin, and do .... They're durable, they exfoliate my skin, and do their job. It doesn't suds up as much as another product meaning I have to use more soap than usual, but it works.",Slightly Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"Typical exfolient. Whats all the hype about? Its no different than any other exfoliator i've tried.  The reviews sold me the product... Nice job<br />It's worth it, I though, experienced no Magic",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,Works good. Took some time to get used to.,Slightly Positive
Eyebrow Tint,"Did they change the ingredients?. I've purchased this kit 2x before with luck.  This kit is different, it's just not covering full color, maybe they changed the ingredients?  I'll finish this box and reorder because I do like the product.  I bought dark brown.  With this box I must leave product on for minutes longer to achieve the usual results.",Slightly Negative

Eyebrow Tint,"if you have no eyebrows or barley any then it’s not for you. at first it looked good then when i went into better lighting you could see first the dark brown looked reddish , and i did a couple of layers to make sure it was even and it was still the solids and had a lot of empty patches .. did it for a second time and nope still did the same thing ..",Slightly Negative
Eyebrow Tint,"Its ok.... Does not stain skin, which i need since i have very sparse brows. Color fades within a week.. but i have oily skin. I had better luck with 1000 hour. Only thing i can say was better bout this is you can use what you need and not have to waste it all at once like 1000 hr. I dont want to be dying em every week tho.",Slightly Negative
Eyebrow Tint,"Like it. I like this product, but if is suppose to last for months, or even weeks before reapplication is needed, that's not the case.  The tint lasts about two days for me.  Still, the product is easy to apply and my brows look amazing for those two days.",Slightly Positive
Eyebrow Tint,"Looks good but.... Works good and looks nice but doesn't last very long, at least for me. Lasts about a week or so. Also when I bought it it said that it was for both eyebrows and lashes but when it arrived it said don't use on lashes may cause blindness?!",Slightly Negative

Eyebrow Tint,"Mixed colors. Half of the capsules are medium brown not dark brown - it’s a crapshoot what color my brows will be on any given day! I’ve bought this brand before and loved it, so I’m hoping it was just a packaging error this time.",Slightly Negative
Eyebrow Tint,"My eyebrows look good. This product works well and is easy to use once you figure out how to open those capsules. I don’t know how long it will last but I also didn’t keep it on very long. Over all though, if I had to do this once a week it would still be better than going to a salon to do it.",Slightly Positive
Eyebrow Tint,"No me gusto.. Si es fácil de usar, pero no dura ni un día, el producto no es bueno.",Slightly Negative
Eyebrow Tint,Not impressed. Not easy to scoop out of the round tray it comes with.  Mixing with capsules is not handy either. Burns my skin the same as Just For Men does.,Slightly Negative

Eyebrow Tint,Ugh. Didn’t change color much and stained everything around me,Slightly Negative
Eyebrow Tint,"What happened???. How is this dark brown? Compare the 2 pics. One labeled Med. Brown, is both darker in the capsules,  and after being mixed.  I didn't dare try the lighter one, although I did apply it side by side on a paper towel. No way!!  I have been using this for a couple years, never seen this before. I WILL BE ASKING FOR A REPLACEMENT.",Negative

False Eyelashes,"Good for practice. What do you want for the price. I purchased these for &#34;practice&#34;. They served the purpose, maybe even better as they're just a black thread. It's had to get them on properly.",Slightly Positive
False Eyelashes,"Great value if you get a lot of decent shaped ones.. These are hit or miss. I’ve gotten them before, and sometimes it’s a good batch and sometimes the shapes are uneven. Hence the inexpensive price, I guess.",Slightly Negative
False Eyelashes,I like the slim strip. I was worried when I got them to see how thin they were but when I put them on they looked so natural. I like the slim strip. It blends well with my natural eye lashes. A+ in my book and you can't beat the price! They are also sturdy enough for multiple uses but I don't feel bad when I get lazy and throw them out because they were so affordable.,Positive
False Eyelashes,"I'd still choose my créme. Might buy again.. I usually only stick to créme lashes the (ones on the left) but I thought I tried these ones out.

Came faster than expected.<br /><br />*Purchased with discount code in exchange for an HONEST IMPARTIAL review",Slightly Positive
False Eyelashes,"Not user friendly. These lashes are crap, the band is extremely thin and flimsy, unable to shape them.",Negative
False Eyelashes,"Phenomenal.... They aren't too long or too thick nor do they give the appearance of being fake eyelashes. If you don't want to put on individual lashes, these are PERFECT!",Positive
False Eyelashes,"Pretty bad. Cheap cheap cheap (they look fake, they feel fake) and you'll be waiting forever to get them.",Slightly Negative
False Eyelashes,"The lashes are super long and pretty but you can't apply a lot .... The band is actually string which is weird, sometimes the band will fray when you cut them because of this. The lashes are super long and pretty but you can't apply a lot of mascara to your real lashes or else you can see the difference between the two. They're good for the price but I doubt I'll order them again.",Slightly Negative
False Eyelashes,These were affordable and very natural but since the length .... These were affordable and very natural but since the length isn't varied you can't really even tell that you're wearing lashes.,Slightly Negative
False Eyelashes,Worst lashes I ever bought. Can't believe I bought these. They are awful. Just awful crayon crap from China. They are cloth and don't bend to your eye shape.,Negative
False Eyelashes,You get what you paid for.. The &#34;hairs&#34; are easily detached and they are mounted on a flimsy piece of string. Very difficult to put on.,Slightly Negative
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Doesn't stick to textured surface!!. Good enough for under $10. Cheaply made for sure. My shower floor is textured so this just slides around and won't stick. I hold it against the wall with the opposite foot to use it. Not easy but doable. The bristles already look worn and I've used it once.,Slightly Negative

Foot Scrubber / Massager,Keep those Gnarly feet clean. Just works!  I use it with a little dab of body wash.,Positive
Foot Scrubber / Massager,"Nice idea, poor implementation. I actually bought this as a gag gift and it worked fine for that, but it doesn't stick down to the shower floor very well, and to use the pumice portion of it, it would have to be tightly secured. They should have included better suction cups.",Slightly Negative
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Ok but the won't stay in one place with suction .... Ok  but the won't stay in one place with suction cups allowing it to move making it difficult to use,Slightly Negative
Foot Scrubber / Massager,"Ridiculous!!!!  Don't waste your money.. The apparatus does not adhere securely to the shower floor and, therefore, slides all over the place when sliding your foot in and out - impossible to use the built in (mine was cracked on arrival) pumice stone.  Total waste of money for this cheap piece of C**P.  I'll be buying a brush with an extended handle.  I wish I could give less than one star!",Negative
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Slides around with stiff bristles. I have this in a normal bathroom surface and it doesn't stay put and slides around from side to side. I feel like I will lose my balance trying to really place my foot on it. This also makes it really hard to use the pumice stone. I also don't like how the bristles feel. They are hard and seem to suck up the soap so there's not much ability to get good suds.,Slightly Negative
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Three Stars. Did not work in my shower,Slightly Negative
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Two Stars. Good idea but don't like keeping it in a tub I use when taking baths.,Slightly Negative

Made my fine hair lose it's volume and pep... similar to how your hair 'stick's when there's static, but without the shocks.",Slightly Negative
Hair Brush,Does not brush just rubs the hair on the top. Unless your hair is as thin as a rat tail this brush is not for you.  I have medium thick curly hair and this brush did 0 to get through it.

Hair Brush,"Does not run through hair.. The brush does not go through all of your hair. It's as though you are only brushing the top layer of your hair with this.

For the price my only complaint is I have been unable to get rid of the ap ads that come on the lock screen every time it sleeps. The screen resolution is fair. Camera pretty much useless. But I wanted a screen larger than my phone and smaller than a standard tablet. Plus I wanted cheap..this fits the bill.,Slightly Positive

I have the 7, i have the 10, and the paperwhite too (can't remember if 7""), but anyway, the 10 for me is too heavy and awkward to sit and watch TV and surf the net, or shop, or play games.

Kitchen Tools,👍. Fits perfectly,Positive
Kitchen Tools,"All arrived bent and dented. Even though the product I'm sure is fine, they shipped it in an envelope rather than in a box, so they all arrived bent and dinged up.

Kitchen Tools,Be Careful about size. I bought this to replace the ones on my electric stove that had rusted. I found that only the small ones would fit the large ones were too big.

Kitchen Tools,"Large Drip Pans Don't fit. The smaller drip pans fit perfectly, but the larger drip pans did not.  While the circumference was good and they fit easily into the hole, they did not seat properly which caused a gap between the range top and the drip pan.  I'm in the process of moving so did not take the time to pursue, but was disappointed that two of the pans could fit and the other two did not.",Slightly Negative
Kitchen Tools,larger pans didn't fit burners. These pans were a good value for the money and seem well made.  They fit just fine in the opening but the internal dimension of the larger burner pan is just a little too small to fit the element.  So when you reinstall the element it can't sit down flat in the pan  I ordered two OEM GE pans and those fit fine.  I kept the smaller ones.,Slightly Negative

Kitchen Tools,Works best with wider gaps and not tight gaps. I couldn't fit into the cracks of my new stove too tight. Maybe that is good news since I won't have to worry about the drips if any.

Smart Scale,"great - until it stops working properly.. Blargh. I used to LOVE this scale, until like others have mentioned, it just decided to stop working.

Well, this looked like a great product for backpacking BUT: if you travel in countries with high humidity the sheets all stick together (same of you get a sheet out once your hands are wet in shower) and you need several sheets to actually ""wash"" hair...all-in-all not such a useful product although the idea is great.",Slightly Negative
Soap Sheets,not what I expected. tried it before I went on vacation. tried to wash a pair of socks. did not seem to clean. socks did not seem fresh. Similar to simply rinsing socks with just water.,Slightly Negative

Soap Sheets,Travelers must buy this. Anyone camping or traveling should carry this in their pack. It is a life saver when no soap is available and great when the only soap available has perfume that gives you a headache. This is head ache free as far as I can tell.,Positive
Soap Sheets,"Unimpressed. I bought a pack of these laundry sheets for a 2 week backpacking trip thinking it would save money on laundry services. These were a waste of money. They don't make clothing smell any better, they don't remove stains. I ended up washing my clothes with hair shampoo instead.",Negative

Stain Remover,"Fine but not great. This works just ok. I found that if there’s a clothing item I forgot to put in the wash that night, it doesn’t remove.

No more worry about “stained” clothes because you couldn’t wash it right away! Travel stain fighter FTW!",Positive
Stain Remover,"Good product-LEAKING in shipment. One of the bottles was leaking when I opened my package but I was able to wipe the bottle down with no issues.

Stain Remover,"Great product. Terrible packaging. Great product.  Terrible packaging.  The neck cracked and leaked the product on my front door step.

Stain Remover,Useless. This product is completely useless. It will not remove any stain from any article of clothing. If I didn't know any better I would assume that this is simply Dreft scented water. I would stay away from these products unless you just really love the scent of Dreft.,Negative
Stain Remover,Works on most / new stains. I already use this brand’s odor eliminator and detergent which i love so I decided to try the stain remover. First time using it.

Subscription Box – Music,"Everything was there as stated. Everything has been good with subscription so far. I had one issue with packaging of an album not looking good. I wrote a review twice the first one they wouldn't use so I rewrote it so we'll see. I have got The Who, and CCR so far and they have been great both 2 album sets.",Slightly Positive
Subscription Box – Music,"I am confused. If I look at the reviews, there seems to be many different shipments instead of all and the same item. Furthermore, today is the 26th if July and my subscription started June 29th, yet I see no offering or shipment yet. I am not sure this is in full working order yet. Needless to say, I got an album I didn't want, I hope I get some of the LPS that were talked about here.",Slightly Negative

Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,Costly. To expensive.,Slightly Negative
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,"Cute idea,  not worthwhile. Great idea but I wasn't keen on the theme.  The toys are kind of large and my cat wasn't excited about most of them.  The only thing she loved was the treats. Not worth the full price for how many items you get,  IMO.",Slightly Negative

Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,Excellent box of natural treats!. My dog was overjoyed! He could not decide what treat to take. If he could think he would have taken all at once. Lol,Positive
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,Expensive outweighs amount of product.. Were mostly reject pieces and not a good amount for my babies. I discovered they like pig ears though so if you want to just get a random box of a few treats for your dogs to try then this would be ok. Just expensive.,Slightly Negative

This is a great value, and a good way to try different items.",Positive
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,"Let down. Ok, so I know to have expectations for subscription boxes be realistic, but this was pretty sufficiently lacking . I was able to get refunded by the company given my dissatisfaction with the quality of the products!  Overall, I was pretty disappointed.  Feel like the box would’ve been worth a $10 subscription.",Slightly Negative
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,Made in USA. My dogs love treats and toys but are heavy chewers. It’s difficult to find long lasting treat and chews. They seemed to enjoy the chews but we’re short lived. No foul odor or less. Made in USA and worth a try.,Slightly Positive
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,"Meow box day is the best day of the month in my house. Sometimes I think my 3 cats like the box better than the toys, but they really enjoy the fresh toys and cat nip each month.

Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,"My cat liked some of the items.. This was my first box. I thought it was pretty cute and packaged nicely. However, my cat only liked two of the toys and didn't like the treats at all. I don't feel it's worth it for picky cats since you never know which items they will and won't like. If your cat isn't picky, though, I'd recommend giving it a try.",Slightly Negative

Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,Ok but not as grand as advertised. Cat loved but no big deal as to content. Cancelled my subscription after first delivery,Slightly Negative
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,"Our Cats love freshly ‘catnipped’ new toys!!. Good quality toys. Value for money is also very good. Kittens & younger cats would go crazy with most, if not all, these toys. Some are safer (no parts to rip off & swallow) & more sturdy (can last w/rough cat play) than others.",Positive
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,"overpriced. even though I received a $10.00 discount on first order, found that still overpriced as to what I could purchase locally.  may be ok for some, but I have 4 dogs so box would not even last 3 days so for me not worth it.",Slightly Negative

He was very excited to get his surprise box.... It gave him lots of joy and comfort for his chew time. Some of his chew bones were Smokey scented. Very happy! Puppy Approved ☺️,Positive
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,Smelled odd and our dog wouldn't touch them 😑. The treats came packed in a plastic zip-top plastic bag. They had a funny smell. Our dog would not touch them.

Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,"You do not get much for the price.. Now they probably cost more, but for a box set, I do not think you get enough for the cost.  We did the trial so not much of a loss and that price was great for what you get.  Maybe each box is different.  Seemed to be pretty good quality.  You may like them.  Not for us.",Slightly Negative
Subscription Box – Shirt,"5 Year Mission. Shirt material, thin, graphics are good, probably need change size from large to XL next delivery..",Slightly Positive
Subscription Box – Shirt,"Disappointed. This feels and looks like a cheaply nade knock-off. Even though it says it’s a woman’s XL, it’s more like  a medium. I hope the next one in this subscription is better!",Slightly Negative

Subscription Box – Snacks,Best snack box!. Great box! Nicely packed with a little pamphlet that explained what everything was & where it was from. I tried a lot of things i probably wouldn't have tried otherwise. I loved just about everything in it! Seems a little overpriced but i think it's worth it just for the experience.,Positive
Subscription Box – Snacks,"Delicious treats!. Some of the treats were absolutely awesome. And i'm thrilled with this box coming from Ireland, I am a huge fan. I can't wait for the next one. my only reason for deducting a star is the box was too small for the contents, and some of the treats were crushed.",Slightly Positive

Subscription Box – Snacks,"Good idea in theory, not so great execution. Mainly crackers in every box. We bought the upgraded subscription and get the same amount as a friend that did the regular size. Disappointed after a few boxes.",Slightly Negative

Subscription Box – Snacks,I love this!. What a great way to learn about a country.  Interesting information and pics and the treats are tasty.,Positive
Subscription Box – Snacks,Interesting. There wasn't anything in the package that I would like to have again but it was interesting what another area of the world considers snacks and the flavors they enjoy.,Slightly Positive

Subscription Box – Snacks,Not worth the price. The idea of international snacks enticed me.  The first box came and had 6 tiny sample sized items.,Slightly Negative
Subscription Box – Snacks,"Overpriced. I really believe I’m paying more than the boxful is worth.  But, I’ll give it one last try and see if it was just this one box.<br /><br />I got the first box at a reduced rate and really feel at the reduced price, it was still too much for cookies and a handful of hard candies",Slightly Negative
Subscription Box – Snacks,Save your money. Food not good. Horrible and do not recommend.  Waited over 6 weeks to get.  The items were not good at all and ended up being disgusting.  I wouldn’t ever buy again. Waste of money.,Negative
Subscription Box – Snacks,"Still the best snacks!. I’ve enjoyed each and every one of these deliveries.  Japanese snacks are truly unique, and I suggest this subscription for all.  The latest delivery was all about the matcha!  Sweet/savory, gels, cookies, crackers… just yum!",Positive
Subscription Box – Snacks,"Super fun and a nice selection, but expensive and mysterious. I enjoyed this, but I Think it would be a lot better if they labeled things 'savory' and 'sweet.'  I like trying new things, but there are times I want savory, and not sweet or vice-versa.  But this is fun, although quite pricey.",Slightly Positive
Subscription Box – Snacks,"Sweets were great, savory sort of gross. Too much savory in this one. I got it on a goldbox deal for $24ish, not worth the full price. Very beautifully presented but just not enough ""wow"" here to keep up subscription.",Slightly Negative

Subscription Box: collectibles,Captain Marvel box. We really liked the Captain Marvel box. Two great pops which my kids really enjoyed. The t-shirt is nice and the glass is very nice quality. This box makes up for the X-Men box which was very subpar.,Positive
Subscription Box: collectibles,"Cool. Most of the box is nonsense, but there are a few gems guaranteed.",Slightly Positive
Subscription Box: collectibles,"Disappointed. I really like the pop, but common guys, it's Deadpool, I was expecting something else, the other elements feels like they put it in the box to fill the empty space of it.",Slightly Negative

Subscription Box: collectibles,"These are a gamble. u never kno whats inside but I promise its not worth $50 of merch as advertised. This boxes are hit and miss.

Tea Infuser,... have been using this for a while now and love it. Very easy to use. I have been using this for a while now and love it. Very easy to use.,Positive
Tea Infuser,"Annoying. I thought this was THE thing for making iced tea, just like everybody else. But air gets trapped in the lid, which makes it float, and then it doesn't steep well. So you tap it, and the lid pops off, and the tea goes everywhere- exactly like it would if you didn't own this. I suppose it's slightly better than nothing...",Slightly Negative
Tea Infuser,Excellent. These never disappoint the loose tea fanatic. That would be me.,Positive
Tea Infuser,"For a convenient cup of tea. I am drinking more teas these days and thought this basket would be convenient. It works just fine, having the right sized cup. What I find is that I want to usually brew more than one cup at a time, so if rarely use this anymore. Does a very good job of filtering teas.nice feature is that it has the lid.",Slightly Positive
Tea Infuser,"Function>Form. It works beautifully and does not leave any residue in my cup.  It is nice and large so that the loose tea can float freely while steeping.  I just wish it were more attractive.  It looks like some sort of internal mechanism for a coffee machine.  But hey, function&#62;form, I suppose.",Slightly Positive
Tea Infuser,"I prefer using empty cloth teabags.. It works, but:  1: It's not portable (you don't want to tote it around with you) and 2:  I prefer buying empty cloth teabags that I can fill with my choice of tea and take anywhere.  Amen.",Slightly Negative
Tea Infuser,I wish I could find a filter this fine without the plastic. I wish I could find a filter this fine without the plastic. Until then this is perfect.<br />the best tea filter I've used.,Positive
Tea Infuser,It does what it was designed to do.. It filters the grounds as designed without any loss in flavor as cloth/paper filters do. I found no grounds in my coffee and it's easy to clean.,Positive
Tea Infuser,Just ok. Its nice but i dont think the price matches with the quality and durability.,Slightly Negative
Tea Infuser,"Not as good as I hoped it would be. There is no way to secure the lid, so the filter can't be submerged, which is limiting.",Slightly Negative
Tea Infuser,Not for coffee. Not good for coffee does not keep it warm and if u use espresso it comes out muddy not smooth. This was meant for teas only it seems,Slightly Negative
Tea Infuser,Not the proper fit. Nothing wrong with the item.<br />It just was not specifically made for the tea pot I purchased and therefore was of no use to me.<br />Great customer service though. They refunded the item.,Slightly Negative
Tea Infuser,"Nothing special. I dont understand why it’s for that price, nothing special",Slightly Negative
Tea Infuser,"Perfect product. These have lasted me literally decades, the metal washes cleanly very easily, and the fine mesh gives WAY better water movement than plastic or punctured metal sheets.<br /><br />This is quite literally the only brewing filter you need, nothing else even comes close.",Positive
Tea Infuser,"Perfect!. I love this brewing basket for make cold-brew tea. It fits in all my containers, is the perfect size for making a pitcher of tea and is easy to clean. This was a great purchase!",Positive
Tea Infuser,Poor Quality. This item is of such poor quality that I doubt that it will last much more than a month or two. Every time I use it I wonder that the hot water didn't cause it to melt.,Negative
Tea Infuser,So hard to find large tea cases like this.  Nice and roomy for larger pitchers. A screw or some type of mechanism to keep the cap on would have been great.,Slightly Positive
Tea Infuser,The only infuser you will need.. Love this. I've already ordered another one for works. Hangs perfect on almost any glass and never any leaves in my cup. This will be the only kind of infuser I ever purchase.,Positive
Tea Infuser,"Works as expected. The first order they sent me the wrong thing, but that’s on the distribution center. These are pretty basic and work fine. Pain to clean, but that’s typical with such items. Used for loose tea & it kept the leaves out of the water. Not sure how durable they are - will come back and update on that.",Slightly Positive
Tea Infuser,Works great. Bought this to use with my new teapot and loose leaf tea. Works great and makes it easy to reuse the tea leaves.,Positive
Tea Infuser,Works Great. I read that making tea from the leaves and not the bag is healthier.  So I bought this and it works well.,Positive
Tea Infuser,"Works great. Works great, can make an entire pot of tea",Positive
Tea Infuser,"works just as expected. I have purchased this exact same tea strainer years ago and left it in a different city.  Works well, and it fits most cups and mugs.",Positive
Tea Infuser,"Works, but discolors badly after a few uses, not worth the premium price. Had high hopes for this - paid a significant premium but it's simply not worth it. There's still a lot of plastic in it, and after a few uses and rapid, thoughtful cleaning it still discolors rapidly after only a few uses and is ultimately no better than alternatives less than half the price",Slightly Negative
Tea Infuser,"wrong size. This is a good product, but somehow the description states that the size is 3.8x3.8x3.8 inches.<br />In fact it is 2x2x3 inches, which is way too small, and is very disappointing.",Slightly Negative

UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"Diaper pail life saver. I love this thing. I love that you don't have to change filters ever so often as well.  A lot of people mention the ""noise."" Have you ever slept in a room with a computer that was ""Sleep?"" That's what the sound reminds me of. Loud enough to know its there but quiet enough to tune out. So far its kept that nasty diaper pail smell at bay.",Positive
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Disappointed. A little disappointed. I have another air purifier by the manufacturer and it works great so I thought this would be perfect for the laundry/litter box room. It was great for size and didn’t scare the kittens.

UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"Doesn't work. I've used it for the last week. It doesn't work. I see a light. I hear a fan, but the cat box smell is still there. The box is in a very small room. I keep the door shut just to make sure, and I clean the box every day. The smell has not changed.",Slightly Negative
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,ehhh. I really can't tell any difference and it is noisy. I bought it for litter box smell. I really cannot tell any difference.,Slightly Negative

UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Great UV light.. Love this little thing.  I had a moldy smell in my bathroom.  Getting ready to renovate but until then bought this to help with smell and toxins.  After about 3 days the smell was completely gone.  Amazing.  Quiet little fan which is not annoying.,Positive

UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"I put this filter near a litter box, and .... I put this filter near a litter box, and it definitely took care of the odor. However, it was incredibly loud for its size. I have since unplugged it.",Slightly Negative
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,It seemed to work really well for the first 3 .... It seemed to work really well for the first 3 days... and then it broke.  Or... just stopped working.  It makes sound but there's no light and the air doesn't change.  Apparently I'm not the only person this has happened to.,Slightly Negative
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Keeps our animal room fresh!. This air freshener is perfect for a room we have a bunny rabbit in! It takes all the smell away! Great product for the money!,Positive

UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"very little difference, not worth the price, and very noisy. very little difference, not worth the price, and very noisy",Slightly Negative
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Very loud.. It is verrry loud for a small unit.  Then the fan started to rattle.  Had to go back.  Such a shame because it is otherwise exactly what I wanted for my small bathroom.,Slightly Negative
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"Works Great. I think this little air purifier works great. It is NOT noisy, as others have opined. There is a low grade, subtle whir that comes from the unit when it's running but not disruptive at all. With the purchase!",Positive
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Works great.. Bought this for the bathroom that houses the cat litter box. Works awesome and we don’t even notice the smell of the litter box.,Positive
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Works ok!. I used this when I had walking pneumonia. I was still sick for 2 months while using this. Maybe it works better as a preventative instead of after you are sick.,Slightly Negative
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,Works!!. My husband has pollen sensitivity.  We put this on his side of the bed and he can definitely tell the difference in the air quality.,Positive

Water Filter,"Causing my water line to stop working. This is the same filter we have always used, but the one we just got a few weeks ago is causing out water dispenser to not work.

Water Filter,Decided to purchase DIRECT FROM SAMSUNG . . .. Had to return.  This item is the lower quality water filter ... a waste of money.

Water is essential to life.,Negative
Water Filter,Defective item. Defective filter. Makes my water filter vibrate like crazy. When the water dispenses it sounds like a machine gun. Have to purchase another replacement for $30+.,Negative
Water Filter,Difficult to install. Poor design.. Very cheaply made and difficult to install. GE overthought the design with small breakable tabs. The instructions are not very clear. Buy two and hope one works.,Slightly Negative

Water Filter,Frigidaire Refrigerators are the worst!. Filter works. But every day with my Frigidaire is painful as they make the worst products in the world.

No more, no less.",Slightly Negative
Water Filter,"it's ok. This is a decent filter the my refrigerator.  I purchased it to filter the water that goes to my ice, but truthfully, the water coming from the refrigerator's water dispenser still had a synthetic taste to it, so I now use a Brita to filter my drinking water.",Slightly Negative

Water Filter,Not Happy. This was not an samsung replacement but a counterfit.  The one I ordered for a replacement was suppossed to have been mineral water filter. Not fresh water. It should have stated it was not a samsung filter.  The box looked old. It was made in Mexico. My water does not taste as good.,Slightly Negative
Water Filter,"Not like the old. For some reason, this filter didn't work like the old ones.  I could hardly get it to put out a steady stream of water.

Water Filter,"Slowed water disbursement. As it should, the filter works well according to the delicious tasting water and ice.

Wet Wipes,"No longer worth it. I have to agree with the other recent reviews. The smaller, flimsier version just isn't worth it anymore.
