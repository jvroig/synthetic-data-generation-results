Amazon Fire Tablet,Nice. I like my tablet. Alexa doesn't work well hands free.,Slightly Positive
Amazon Fire Tablet,VERY DISAPPOINTING. I was really looking forward to this tablet to read instead of my defunct Kindle.

Very disappointed to have an issue with this product right out of the package.,Negative
Amazon Fire Tablet,"Worst picture and color. Perhaps I got a dud but the screen was a cream color when it was supposed to be white and it was so strong that i ended up with a migraine just looking at it start up. I can't imagine reading on it which is why I bought it. And yes, I know you can adjust the brightness and go to dark mode. Not worth it.",Negative

Amazon Fire TV Stick,"Cannot disable Alexa.. I returned this product realizing that the only way to disable Alexa is to physically open the remote and rip out the microphone.  The only way to turn the product off is to unplug it and remove the remote's batteries.<br /><br />If you don't want Alexa in your home, do not buy this product.",Negative

Amazon Fire TV Stick,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!. I had an older Fire Stick remote which worked great. Amazon sent me an offer to ""upgrade"" to this Alexa version. It is a total piece of garbage. It doesn't understand ANY of the requests no matter how I word them. After 15 minutes of trying, I end up finding it the old-fashioned way. Amazon should refund my money for this nonsense.",Negative
Amazon Fire TV Stick,"Easy to set up, easy to use. Cost and ease of use are fantastic.  So tired of paying for cable tv when there is nothing thing worth watching.  There are a few dislikes.  There is not a good TV guide and some channels are not obtainable without paying a subscription.",Slightly Positive
Amazon Fire TV Stick,"Fire Stick Works great but can interfere with TV antenna if you're using one. Oct 2017 Review Update:  Amazon has done a great job updating the Fire Stick software, and all of my complaints from my initial review have been fixed.  The Menus and Voice Interface are intuitive, easy to use, and do what you'd expect.",Positive
Amazon Smart Plug,"ALexa and the smart plug work.. It works as promised.  I bought mine as a combined item with Echo.  As a stand alone plug, it seems expensive.",Slightly Positive

So technically my glasses got messed up because of this product.",Negative
Anti-slip wax for glasses,Works. Okay product,Slightly Positive
Back Cushion,Bizarre. Wow no. First of all. First time I tried to use it I slid off my chair and hit the ground. Later when I kept trying to find a way to use it it left deep deep gouge marks in my skin. Def a waste. And painful. Bizarrely painful,Negative
Back Cushion,Not worth 70 dollars. It's okay. But it's not big enough. It cuts into my thighs and other areas. My butt feels more fatiqued and sore. I actually had to stop using it because my rump hurts. Definitely not worth 70 dollars. Sorry!,Negative
Back Cushion,"Too small. Didn't work out for me.<br />- This thing is way too small. 16"" in width and 9"" in height barely covers the width of my back and I'm just an average size person.<br />- The straps they provide are not even close enough to  wrap around a standard chair to hold it in place.<br />- After sitting less than 10 minutes, my back is so sore.",Negative

Cleaner,does it all. Who knew Mr Clean could clean up everything!,Positive
Cleaner,"DON'T DO IT !!!. NO! Do Not use Magic Erasers on anything! I can't believe they are even still selling any of these things. They serve no purpose and will damage anything they touch. If you care about the surface you are about to clean, keep these things away or the surface WILL be damaged.",Negative
Cleaner,"Durability which it is not. Do not let the name fool you, this is a plain sponge, one use on my cabinet doors, fridge, and microwave and it fell apart and had pot holes in it.  I think there is 4 in the box but one good scrub with each and they are not worth taking from the store...made for wiping mot scrubbing.",Negative
Cleaner,Five Stars. Great bulk value!!,Positive
Cleaner,Five Stars. Love these!,Positive
Cleaner,Five Stars. These things can clean almost anything.,Positive
Cleaner,"For the most part it holds up and does twice the work the other does not. spring cleaning, major cleaning, this will hold up to 2 of the of other one. Personally a better deal.

Cleaner,"Ohhh A soft scrubby. I was surprised how well this cleaned.  Removed grease  from places I had trouble with before. Would love if it was a little larger, still, works wonders if you add a bit of cleaner or viviparous to sponge.  If you have reactions to cleanser because of odor or chemicals this is a must have.",Positive

Coffee Filter,... to hold up to the slow pour coffee we love.. Too small to hold up to the slow pour coffee we love.,Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,👌🏼. 👌🏼,Positive
Coffee Filter,"A little small. These don't quite fit my My K Cup universal reusable coffee pod. If I push it all the way in, there's room at the top and the grounds go over. Even if I just put enough grounds in to go to the top of the filter, you still have to pound it against the garbage can or another cup to get it all out because it's down in there.",Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,"Bad Design. Takes a lot to place into the coffee machine, and the coffee doesn't taste good",Negative
Coffee Filter,Be careful to check which machines it fits before ordering. Doesn't fit my machine,Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,Careful that your Keurig Machine allows the use of this item.. Unfortunately I have the Keurig 2.0 machine and it doesn't allow you to use this K-cup filter.,Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,"Charcoal Water Filters, Replaces Keurig 05073. I really like these filters, but they fit more snuggley in my holder than the Keurig brand. I use filtered water anyway from my frig water filteration system so I probably don't even need these, but for the price I ordered them just because. I do think if I had well water I'd definietly use these / keep them on hand for company.",Slightly Positive
Coffee Filter,"Defeats the purpose. It defeats the purpose of the speed and ease of using a Keurig. I wouldn't recommend it, used it once, it's difficult to measure the right amount- took me back to the 90s when I made bad coffee. I can't recommend it.",Negative
Coffee Filter,"Does as advertised. Haven't had any issues, no paper taste, no rips, wish there were more in package for the money would be my only critique.",Slightly Positive
Coffee Filter,Doesn't fit. Doesn't fit,Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,"Easy To Use BUT..... I bought one of these reusable filters with the intent of using some of my favorite Starbucks blends with my Keurig Coffee Maker. Although it is easy to use, I found it a bit too messy after just popping in a K-Cup for over a year.<br /><br />It's doable, don't get me wrong, but I think I'm just spoiled with the K-Cups.",Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,Epic Fail. This is the third one of these I've tried. None of them fit the way they say and none of them work. Can't return it without a fee.  Spews hot coffee out all over the place. Lid blows off and there is a terrible mess. I've had Keurigs since they first came out. I have tried every version of this filter they make. Not a one has ever worked successfully.,Negative
Coffee Filter,Filters. Thought I give these a try.  They seem to be pretty similar to the name brand version at a cheaper price.  I just used one to replace the name brand version.  So far to good.,Positive
Coffee Filter,"Four Stars. Far as I can tell, these are ok.",Positive
Coffee Filter,here mom.. Bought this for my Minie Keurig and it didnt fit. Even though it said everywhere i looked that it would. So my mom got a new one for her Keurig.,Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,"Not for 2.0. My kids have one. Works great but, not in my new 2.0 machine. They do not tell you that until you read the directions",Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,"Not Good Reusable Coffee Filter. Although this reusable coffee filter says it fits my Keurig machine, it does not.",Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,Not that great. Leaves a lot of residue in your coffee.,Slightly Negative
Coffee Filter,Terrible Smell / Terrible Taste. These smelled like fabric softener and the smell affected the taste of the coffee. A complete waste of time/money that I had to send back. I ended up purchasing the unbleached variety and they were perfect. Don't bother with these.,Negative
Coffee Filter,"Tidy, not overpowering the chemex glass.. I guess I thought these would be a flattened cone shape.  They are.  They're the square filters just trimmed to fit the cone at the very top.  So, one part of the filter has double thickness, the other part a single thickness.  Ok.",Slightly Positive
Coffee Filter,Very low quality. Unusable. Seam falls apart when in touch with hot coffee. It should not be sold because it's defective. I wasted my money.,Negative
Coffee Filter,"Work Fine. I purchased the Keurig Solo Filter Stainless Steel Mesh pods and these filters.  The filters work nicely but they are a good 1/4&#34; shorter than the pods so you don't get enough coffee in the pod for a nice &#34;potent&#34; cup.  However, they do a nice job filtering and keeping residue out of your coffee.  Just wish they were a little deeper.",Slightly Positive
Coffee Maker Cups,"Cheap product but just what I needed. I bought one 5+ years ago due the same cost as this multi pack. These ones are much lower quality, but I like that you can dispose after a number of uses without breaking the bank. Plus, reusable is important overall.",Slightly Positive
Coffee Maker Cups,"Horrible! Returned. If I could give it less than 1 star I would. I returned because water went everywhere, I mean everywhere! I truly tried to figure out why and never could. I believe it it because the bottom is mesh. I compared it to my original Keurig filter and that one worked just fine.  Horrible! don't waste your time of money.",Negative
Coffee Maker Cups,"These filter cups DO NOT work in a Keurig K400 2.0 series brewer,as advertised. all consumers read the description carefully. These filter cups DO NOT work in a Keurig K400 2.0 series brewer.. as advertised. All consumers should read this description VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE PURCHASING...",Negative
Coffee Maker Cups,"Useless.. Useless. The entire bottom is wire mesh and allows far too much water through.  You can hear the pressure of the water pushing through your store-bought k-cups. With these, the water just flows through freely. The coffee brewed using these is flavorless and weak. Notice your k-cups aren't surrounded with wire mesh...  truly, a useless product.",Negative
Coffee Scoop,"Another plastic gadget made in China, just ok.. Interesting gadget for coffee pod users. It can be awkward and a little messy to use. Received it as a Christmas gift and will continue to use it until I can’t stand it or something better comes along. This one takes practice to use it .Maybe made in the USA out of stainless steel. This one is plastic made in China.",Slightly Negative
Coffee Scoop,Works ok. So far it seems to work ok,Slightly Positive
Cotton Rounds,"A little disapointed. the pads are a little in the thin side, which may be ok for some type of other function, but for me they are just a tad too thin.",Slightly Negative
Cotton Rounds,Bad. They're splitting in half and really rough,Negative
Cotton Rounds,Cheapest cotton pads available.. These are about as thin as loose leaf paper. Do not use.,Negative
Cotton Rounds,Cotton pads. I found then to be slightly thinner than the more expensive brand names but they still do their job as needed.,Slightly Positive
Cotton Rounds,"Not for me. This is the first time I have ever been disappointed in cotton pads. Cheaply made, fall apart while trying to use them to apply serums and such. I will not be purchasing again.",Negative
Crown / Tiara,Arrived broken. Arrived broken:( such a pretty crown... my daughter is so sad. Hopefully they’ll swap it out.,Negative
Crown / Tiara,"Beautiful but Couldn’t use. Beautiful, but very heavy and hurt her head so badly, we were unable to use it.",Slightly Negative
Crown / Tiara,"Beautiful. This is a beautiful crown, very heavy and seems well made.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does not have the little loop on the ends by the combs, as shown in the photos, and I wanted the loops for a ribbon.",Slightly Positive
Crown / Tiara,Breaks easily.. It unfortunately broke very quickly despite being careful with it. I'm pretty disappointed.,Negative
Crown / Tiara,"Broke the first day. The tiara was purchased for my granddaughter.  Unfortunately the decorated area seperated on one side of the band on the first day of use. I can fix it with epoxy, however, if not for that I would have given it a 5 star overall",Slightly Negative
Crown / Tiara,"cute. Bought for a party...have not used them yet, but they are cute",Slightly Positive
Curling Brush / Iron,defective. Purchased in Dec.  did not use till vacation last week. It did not work Won't heat up,Negative
Curling Brush / Iron,"Does a good job. This curling brush does what I had expected.  It is very hard to find a curling brush in the one inch size.  My only complaint is that the bristles are a little sharp on my scalp.  If they were more rounded, I would have given it 5 stars.",Slightly Positive
Curling Brush / Iron,I do not recommend it. I am disappointed in it.  I have a Conair bristle brush that works very well but it is larger.  My hair is short and coarse so I thought the 1/2 inch brush would do well.  There do not seem to be enough bristles on the brush to grab hair.  I do not recommend it.,Negative
Curling Brush / Iron,"Not effective, curls don't last. I have several hot brushes, but most are hot air.  I wanted to try this concept for quick style touchups.  It doesn't work nearly as well as the hot air brushes, doesn't get that hot, and the styling doesn't last for me--and my hair curls quite easily.  I just don't use it, but always go back to my old hot air brush.",Negative
Curling Brush / Iron,Three Stars. it serves a purpose,Slightly Positive
Dietary Supplement,.. It tastes and smells VERY fishy.,Slightly Negative

Dietary Supplement,Keeps the mind lubed. Excellent product.  Excellent service.,Positive
Dietary Supplement,Misleading product pictures. The sodium content is 61% which is very different than what is shown online. This is not healthy for anyone of any age. It’s basically salt with a tiny bit of minerals.,Negative
Dietary Supplement,"Nasty, terrible, disgusting and salty!!! Stay away. Disgusting!!! It’s super salty and ruined an entire fruit smoothie I added it to. I even threw up from the taste. I have had Irish Sea moss before and put it in my smoothies no problem but this one is just nasty and terrible!!!!",Negative
Dietary Supplement,Nice Product!. I bought this product because I read in a periodical that Omega 3's are what we need for inflamation.  It's better than Omega 6's.  So I switched over to this Fish Oil product and I'm enjoying the lemon taste.  I take two teaspoons a day and the taste is not offensive at all.  I will order another when this one runs out and hopefully my body will do much better in the future.,Positive
Dietary Supplement,"Surprisingly delicious.. Both of us are taking it everyday, this is a wonderful product.  No Fishy taste, has a slight lemon flavor. We will order again. Speedy delivery",Positive
Dietary Supplement,The BEST fish oil EVER!!. GREAT STUFF....The only fish oil that significantly lowered my cholesterol/trig levels within a couple of months!!  ALSO.....no nasty FISH burping taste!!!  The ONLY way to go!,Positive

Dishwasher Magnet,Adhesive not too strong. Looks okay when display. A little too big. The adhesive not too strong,Slightly Negative
Dishwasher Magnet,"Damaged my new stainless steel dishwasher.. The seller advises “In inbuilt Industrial magnets are covered by soft silica to protect dishwasher.  After a few weeks of use,  I took the product off my dishwasher.  The magnet  rusted through and left rust on my new  stainless steel Dishwasher . The  dishwasher is now damaged.",Negative

Earbuds,"Battery life is BAD!. Short battery life, kind of large for my ears.",Slightly Negative
Earbuds,Bluetooth issues after couple of weeks. Bluetooth doesn’t want to connect every time I’m trying. So what’s the point of me spending 30$ for something that doesn’t work well!!,Negative
Earbuds,color was slightly different than in the picture. pretty good,Slightly Positive
Earbuds,Decent audio with convenient charging.. Decent audio but not great for critical listening. They aren't noise canceling and they don't isolate much better than any rubber buds. I enjoy the battery life and case with extra battery. Also the wireless charging.,Slightly Positive
Earbuds,Three Stars. Pretty good basic headphones.,Slightly Positive
Earbuds,totally worthless. there was no battery. I had trouble putting on a smaller ear piece so they would fit in my ears. I finally did that but it did not cancel out any noise and I could not hear anything out of one earpiece.  I am stuck with them because the company won't take them back.  DO NOT BUY!!!!,Negative
Earbuds,Very good buy!!!. I like this product. The voice notification is surprisingly refreshing. The sound is rich. Cons very difficult to open opening for charging and to remove buds. I will be buying the quick charger so that I won't eventually break the door for charging port.,Positive
Echo Dot,A good addition to my room. I CAN TURN MY LIGGHTS ON AND OFF AND TELL IT TO PLAY MUSIC WOW AND IT FARTS FOR ME GOOD PRODUCT GET ONE,Positive
Echo Dot,Alexa has problems understanding at times.. Alexa has problems understanding may times. We have names for lights etc. Sometimes we have to repeat the name several times before alexa understands. Sometimes I think alexa is getting tired of my voice and ignores me like my wife.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Alexa, acts like she can’t hear.. I like the 3rd Generation way better! I have to say Alexa wayyyy too many times with this one. It’s a pain. Lord forbid im in the shower and want to play the next song, I have to practically scream. Overall wouldn’t recommend the 4th. The 3rd is much better quality and sound.",Negative
Echo Dot,Amazing: But isn't a bluetooth speaker like the 1st Gen. Does not play music via blue tooth from a mobile device. The first generation Dot plays music via blue tooth from our phones just fine. This one does not.,Slightly Negative
Echo Dot,"Do Not Buy. It use to be a good system. As of 9/30/2020 it has gone into the pot. This has been going on for days now. At times it works. Most of the time it does not. Not a good situation for an elderly home counting on voice activation. If you want a new toy that tells you stupid jokes, it is a good product.",Negative
Echo Dot,"Echo Dot is garbage! I hate it!. Echo dot is trash. Any variation in wifi and the thing will never work again.  The stupid thing will keep repeating go to app, go to app, go to app.  Got me so angry that I smashed the dot on the ground.  Siri is 100 times better!!!",Negative
Echo Dot,I don't feel comfortable having something recording everything that is said. She listens to everything she starts talking when I have the TV on.  I don't feel comfortable having something recording everything that is said.  She's only supposed to respond when you call her name.  It proves you have no privacy if you use this thing. .  She is unhooked and sent back,Negative
Echo Dot,Parked Mine and got 3rd Gen. Parked Mine and got 3rd Gen,Negative
Echo Dot,Pure trash. A terrible device. Pay walls for a lot of things like music even though I have prime.<br /><br />It can't understand most requests. Do not buy it.,Negative
Echo Dot,RETURN. RETURN,Negative
Echo Dot,Sound quality is poor. I returned it because the older generation sounded better. I tried this to see if it is an improvement - it is not. Do not buy. You’ll regret it. No bass sound.,Negative

Exfoliating Cloth,"a little rough for me. the cloth is huge, and a little rough for my skin",Slightly Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"but good product. I normally use straight sugar. Not as rough as I expected, but good product. I normally use straight sugar, so I like a very rough exfoliation.",Slightly Positive
Exfoliating Cloth,"Not for humans. I find it insanely rough, like rubbing my skin with coarse sand paper. I might use it on a rhinoceros, but not on a human. Yes, I lathered it up as recommended. Painful! Where I used it on my forearm the skin appears to have developed a rash. At my house this product is headed for the trash.",Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,"One Star. this is not the genuine product, I used this product for a long time it is not the same.",Negative
Exfoliating Cloth,Three Stars. a,Slightly Positive

False Eyelashes,I like the slim strip. I was worried when I got them to see how thin they were but when I put them on they looked so natural. I like the slim strip. It blends well with my natural eye lashes. A+ in my book and you can't beat the price! They are also sturdy enough for multiple uses but I don't feel bad when I get lazy and throw them out because they were so affordable.,Positive
False Eyelashes,Love these. These are the best,Positive
False Eyelashes,Nice lashes!. Very Nice and thin like I want them often receive compliments on them and many think they are real.  Will definitely order more.,Positive
False Eyelashes,"Not user friendly. These lashes are crap, the band is extremely thin and flimsy, unable to shape them.",Negative
False Eyelashes,"Phenomenal.... They aren't too long or too thick nor do they give the appearance of being fake eyelashes. If you don't want to put on individual lashes, these are PERFECT!",Positive
False Eyelashes,Worst lashes I ever bought. Can't believe I bought these. They are awful. Just awful crayon crap from China. They are cloth and don't bend to your eye shape.,Negative

Foot Scrubber / Massager,"Ridiculous!!!!  Don't waste your money.. The apparatus does not adhere securely to the shower floor and, therefore, slides all over the place when sliding your foot in and out - impossible to use the built in (mine was cracked on arrival) pumice stone.  Total waste of money for this cheap piece of C**P.  I'll be buying a brush with an extended handle.  I wish I could give less than one star!",Negative
Foot Scrubber / Massager,waste of money. this product was a waste of money.  the pumice stone fell out as well as all the bristles and the suction cups after a few moves would not go back into the holes they belonged in.,Negative

Soap Sheets,"Beware of the small size. Quite surprised at the extremely small size. They are only slightly larger than the breath freshener strips. Good for single items washed out in the bathroom sink. The whole package would be required if using an actual washing machine. Given that, rather expensive for what you get.",Slightly Negative
Soap Sheets,Harmful ingredients. I bought these so I could easily sanitize my hands while on the go. When they arrived the packaging says contains ingredients that are recognized by the state of California as carcinogens. Needless to say I do not want to be using this product and then touching my infant,Negative
Soap Sheets,"Unimpressed. I bought a pack of these laundry sheets for a 2 week backpacking trip thinking it would save money on laundry services. These were a waste of money. They don't make clothing smell any better, they don't remove stains. I ended up washing my clothes with hair shampoo instead.",Negative
Soap Sheets,"Very Strong Perfume!. I purchased this because I thought it was going to be fragrance free.  Since I am allergic to fragrances and perfumes, I can't use anything with a strong scent.<br /><br />This has a strong scent, very perfume-y!  I can't use it, even though I left it outside for a few days, hoping the smell would go away.<br /><br />If you have perfume allergies, avoid this!",Negative
Soft Tissues,4 of the cubes were broken open & damp. 4 of the cubes were broken open & damp,Slightly Negative
Soft Tissues,A/ok. A-ok and great price.,Positive
Soft Tissues,Astonished. I'm astonished these get a high review score. About the only thing they're good for is blowing your nose with your fingers.,Negative
Soft Tissues,Bad condition. The box was open and crushed,Negative
Soft Tissues,"Box is mostly air. Surprisingly few tissues in box and they don't dispense cleanly, so you end up with torn ones or more than you want. Tissues themselves are great.",Slightly Negative
Soft Tissues,Boxes came damaged...and we had paid a premium.. Items came damaged...clearly were boxed damaged...low value and disappointed.,Negative
Soft Tissues,Boxes crushed. Three of the Kleenex boxes in the case were utterly crushed.,Slightly Negative
Soft Tissues,Good price. The only way to buy them in bulk,Positive
Stain Remover,Baby safe but doesn’t get stains out. Love the idea but stains don’t come out easy and I don’t like the smell it leaves on clean clothes.,Slightly Negative
Stain Remover,"Does not work!. This does not get stains out. Blow outs, spit up or Breast milk doesn’t work at all.",Negative
Stain Remover,"Nice product, goes quick.. Only taking one star because it didn’t last as long as I hoped. Worked great on existing stains from dog and other household spills.",Slightly Positive
Stain Remover,Useless. This product is completely useless. It will not remove any stain from any article of clothing. If I didn't know any better I would assume that this is simply Dreft scented water. I would stay away from these products unless you just really love the scent of Dreft.,Negative
Subscription Box – Beauty,"A list of items that are in the kit along with there uses. I wish they would put a list of what is what. They give you 5 items.  For a teenager just starting out she didn't know what was what. When I was in thr other club ( which I canceled because this said full sized items not samples ) some of them are sample items WHY? Also, I wish they did eyes & lips together.",Negative
Subscription Box – Beauty,"a little disappointed. I didn't personally like the only 2 lip things in the kit, gloss. I am very disappointed that in the middle of summer there was no lip mosturizer in the bag at all. It had two make up products that are ok I guess.  I was expecting to get ALL lip stuff but that was not the case. I am going to give it one more month to impress me or I will cancell.",Slightly Negative
Subscription Box – Beauty,Not a lip box-do not order. Ordered on prime day. Just received yesterday. No indication on packaging or in the package as to what it was or who it was from. I thought this can’t be the lip box because there’s only one lip product. That lip product is a lip balm. Not as advertised and not worth the money. Don’t do it!,Negative
Subscription Box – Beauty,"save your money. this was worse than sending a 2 yr old in the Dollar Tree blindfolded.  products smelled terrible, did not stay on and was a waste of time and money.",Negative
Subscription Box – Beauty,"Waste of money!. Not what expected what so ever.  The colors I received are terrible. In fact, I cancelled my subscription immediately. This is a waste of money. Not sure if they were trying to push vampire colors or Halloween colors but they are going in the trash. Do not purchase.",Negative
Subscription Box – Beauty,"What a waste, it all went in the trash!!!. The colors were disgusting! I received an orangish-red lip crayon, that I can’t think of one person I know could “pull-off”. An excrement colored matte cream...that when applied, literally looked like smeared feces. The other 3 items were trial sized non-puppies. I cancelled immediately!",Negative
Subscription Box – Educational Toys,"80% great!. 10 months and it went well. The toys were nice. I cancelled today because we got a 3 year old math toy. It was alright, but this toy was garbage and way below the age limit for 5-7. A toy a few months back was a bit lacking as well. 80% of the time it's great. My son is 6, and a few of the toys were way under him, to the point of worthlessness.",Slightly Negative

Subscription Box – Music,"Everything was there as stated. Everything has been good with subscription so far. I had one issue with packaging of an album not looking good. I wrote a review twice the first one they wouldn't use so I rewrote it so we'll see. I have got The Who, and CCR so far and they have been great both 2 album sets.",Slightly Positive
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,Broke. Almost everything you wise broke instant my cat got ahold of it,Negative

Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,Fun to get. My Labrador’s loved the treats in this box. They are hard on treats and toys. They blast through them pretty quickly.,Positive
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,Smelled odd and our dog wouldn't touch them 😑. The treats came packed in a plastic zip-top plastic bag. They had a funny smell. Our dog would not touch them. They were a total waste of money for us. I canceled as soon as I saw she didn't like them. This was very disappointing!,Negative
Subscription Box – Pet Toys and Treats,"Wow, so disappointed.. Extremely disappointed.  I was very taken back to open the box to find 6 items thrown in a box with a piece of tissue paper.  I would not recommend this product.  It all went to the garbage.",Negative
Subscription Box – Shirt,"5 Year Mission. Shirt material, thin, graphics are good, probably need change size from large to XL next delivery..",Slightly Positive
Subscription Box – Snacks,"Delicious treats!. Some of the treats were absolutely awesome. And i'm thrilled with this box coming from Ireland, I am a huge fan. I can't wait for the next one. my only reason for deducting a star is the box was too small for the contents, and some of the treats were crushed.",Slightly Positive
Subscription Box – Snacks,Save your money. Food not good. Horrible and do not recommend.  Waited over 6 weeks to get.  The items were not good at all and ended up being disgusting.  I wouldn’t ever buy again. Waste of money.,Negative

Subscription Box: collectibles,"Cool. Most of the box is nonsense, but there are a few gems guaranteed.",Slightly Positive
Subscription Box: collectibles,Fun for collectors. My son loved the box. The only problem is that he got a different shirt size than selected.,Slightly Positive
Tea Infuser,"Annoying. I thought this was THE thing for making iced tea, just like everybody else. But air gets trapped in the lid, which makes it float, and then it doesn't steep well. So you tap it, and the lid pops off, and the tea goes everywhere- exactly like it would if you didn't own this. I suppose it's slightly better than nothing...",Slightly Negative
Tea Infuser,"For a convenient cup of tea. I am drinking more teas these days and thought this basket would be convenient. It works just fine, having the right sized cup. What I find is that I want to usually brew more than one cup at a time, so if rarely use this anymore. Does a very good job of filtering teas.nice feature is that it has the lid.",Positive
Tea Infuser,Poor Quality. This item is of such poor quality that I doubt that it will last much more than a month or two. Every time I use it I wonder that the hot water didn't cause it to melt.,Negative
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"A quiet hum. A quiet hum so I know it's working. Not sure that it is really making a difference, but I like to think I breathe easier when this is plugged in.",Slightly Positive
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,As loud as a jet engine. This is ridiculously lout. Do much do that it is unussble,Negative
UV-C Sanitizer and Deodorizer,"Does the job in a small room. Bought this to put in a small empty bedroom where I keep a litter box, it does a good job keeping the air clean. It is a bit noisy, but I don't mind that since it's in an empty room.",Slightly Positive
Water Filter,... seem to work well and maked the water taste funny.. Although the product had the right markings indicating it was made by GE the product doesn't seem to work well and maked the water taste funny.,Slightly Negative
Water Filter,"Black junk comes out of filter. Evidently, this is an activated carbon filter and improperly constructed. After just a couple of months use, I get black globs coming out and stopping up the refrigerator dispenser nozzle. Will never buy again.",Negative
Water Filter,Certainly does the job. It's just right lasts about a year and the water never tastes&#34;off&#34; Easy to install and the water runs faster after replacement,Positive
Water Filter,"CHEAPER THAN THE OEM STORE. Bought this item due to its cost and frustration received whenever ordering from the OEM Frigidaire store online where they misplace my orders and have no clue of what is going on.  These guys fulfilled the order faster, cheaper and with no hassel.",Positive
Water Filter,Convenient to reorder. Convenient,Slightly Positive
Water Filter,"Easy to install. Unlike other reviews, this works as expected. The water flow is good and arrived fast",Positive
Water Filter,"Slowed water disbursement. As it should, the filter works well according to the delicious tasting water and ice. Our only problem is that this time, the change brought on a slow moving water system. We figure something must be lodged in the line. Certainly not calling out the GE guy to repair it for the cost of a new fridge! Any suggestions out there?",Slightly Negative
Water Filter,"These are Knockoffs!. This water filter is NOT legitimate.  Does not filter anything!  Total rip off!  Noticed unfiltered water and filtered water tasted exactly the same, so I had my ""filtered"" water tested, and it matched up exactly to ""un-filtered"" water.  Rip off!",Negative
Water Filter,Works fine. It's a filter to replace the one I had and it seems to be working just fine. Not sure what else I can tell you...,Slightly Positive
