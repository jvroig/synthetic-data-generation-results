none,I was really excited to find a great deal on batteries. I would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls. And basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down. I could not believe how many batteries I went through for a child's toy. These batteries don't hold there ground against brand name. I burnt through 24 amazon batteries in one month on my son's hot wheel course. Just basic use maybe an hour a day at most. Brand name has lasted 2 months.,Negative
none,"This looked easy, but hard to setup if no experience with other than Apple products",Slightly Negative
none,"Serves the purpose for which it was bought, ; I.e. Facebook",Positive
none,These batteries don't seem to last as long as other brands.,Slightly Negative
none,Good kids tablet for games and videos but the charger is pretty annoying.,Slightly Negative
none,"This spray smells amazing, it does claim to be completely natural so I am wondering if it really is since the smell is very well... processed in my opinion, that being said, it does look completely natural it's completely transparent and once you apply it it doesn't feel as sticky as other products I've used before it really gives the hair a very natural look and for having just applied it a few minutes ago my hair feels extremely soft to the touch which gives me a pretty good idea that this is a good hair spray. The presentation is really pretty and looks cute and clean as well. I love it! I just hope it works well in the long run! The only problem I had (completely unrelated to the spray itself) is that they left it at my neighbors door instead.",Positive
none,"Avid fan of Allure Mag, been reading for at Least 10 yrs so readily excitedly joined<br /><br />PROS::::<br />cheap convenient way to try new Beauty/skin products<br />Fast delivery<br /><br />CONS:::<br />None of products I received were What was depicted in the graphic. I contacted seller, asking if what was sent monthly was same as shown in graphic and received a puzzling reply ((smh))<br />scented sample was strong & harsh<br />No lipstick Was hoping for at least tube of lipstick, gloss, etc<br />Received a notice that price increases with Ictober shipment. MAIN reason I subscribed was because of low cost to try new Skin products. Am going to wait for next shipment before I decide to continue or unsubscribe",Negative
none,Its a battery nothing much to say. I usually buy at costco but the convenience of the free delivery was the decision breaker this time.,Slightly Positive
none,"I was hoping he would not want to put it down, like the other tablet he had (sprout chubby )But he stills wants my phone.",Slightly Negative
none,Prob good for price but to many bugs. Freezes up often and games don't always load,Slightly Negative
none,"So at first I was happy, but my computer mouse started flashing red (low battery) about a week of having the new battery. Not impressed with battery life, but it works short term.",Slightly Negative
none,"not sure this really is worth it, maybe if they would allow you to have a collection to pick from....",Slightly Negative
none,At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.,Slightly Positive
none,"My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.",Slightly Positive
none,"Lots of research -<br />Needed a 47 inch HDTV for living room - old style TV shelves built in to include TV position that was too.<br />Based on reviews - caught a quick sales price opportunity and pulled the trigger. So happy with purchase.<br />1. Had to search online for the best picture calibration. Out of the box the picture was not good. Comparing it to our LG 60 plasma.<br />2. Wanted and LED/LCD type TV - but a good picture and price. Our LG plasma has been flawless.<br />3. Wanted a thin TV with a good picture for 3D and wanted it to be passive this time. we have the active 3D downstairs.<br />So far the 8600 has meet our expectations and exceeded some. Once we got the picture calibrated CNET review.... its all been very good.<br />TV is lightweight - we're currently using the TV stand but have plans to mount it on an articulating bracket once we can modify the TV cubby.<br />Remote is their magic remote. our first experience w/ the magic remote was with our plasma (2010), used it twice and stored it.<br />since this was the only remote, had no choice. It was easy to use and get the 8600 updated (firmware), online - Ethernet and change settings for calibration. but since then we only use the remote to turn on the TV since we have DirecTV and use that remote for the channels plus have a Harman Kardon receiver that we use for volume etc. most likely we'll be setting one or both of those up as universal remotes. only make sense.<br /><br />we only used the audio speakers on the 8600 for two weeks, decent sounding but not going to fill the room. we use our Harman Kardon as the workhorse now. once you go HDMI and the receiver the 8600 speakers become inop.<br /><br />the good news - a decently strong person can lift the set by themselves to set it in position or move it to make changes. the picture is good, 3D is decent, not eye popping like active 3D does but good enough for our living room and much cheaper with almost free 3D passive glasses.<br /><br />con - not much we can say.... wish I had got the 55&#34; but the extra few hundred would have put me in the dog house especially when the TV would not have fit inside the tv cubby.",Slightly Positive
none,Drain quick,Negative
none,I feel like they don't work as long.,Slightly Negative
none,limited apps and a bit thicker than iPad but works,Slightly Positive
none,price is good... look good on paper.. some i have are bad.. after few times use .won't buy again unless quality goes up..,Negative
none,"Great for reading in the sunlight. As well as light, and easy on the wrist. Great product, but a little speedy.",Slightly Positive
none,You get what you pay for. Playtime works when it wants to. Went on a long trip and the videos we downloaded had issues playing most of the time. My son is almost 2. He gets bored of it quickly. The pros are the price and it is well protected externally.,Slightly Negative
none,"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy.",Positive
none,There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.,Slightly Negative
none,It works nice. Still seems like ancient techonology compared to any apple product,Slightly Positive
none,"They don't seem to work except in very low energy items. Can't get them to work in my remotes or in a motion sensor light, but it works on a smaller switch activated night light. :-( oh well",Negative
none,"Great idea but I wasn't keen on the theme. The toys are kind of large and my cat wasn't excited about most of them. The only thing she loved was the treats. Not worth the full price for how many items you get, IMO.",Negative
none,"batteries used primarily for remotes, batteries last for about 1 month",Negative
none,"Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on.",Slightly Negative
none,Needs to be more simpler. parental contorl still need to be better,Slightly Negative
