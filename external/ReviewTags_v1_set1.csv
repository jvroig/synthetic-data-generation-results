Insect Repellent,As advertised.  Good price.. thanks,"[""value""]"
Insect Repellent,"Avon SKIN-SO-SOFT Bug Guard PLUS IR3535®.... The oviduct is very easy to use, non greasy, and covers the area very well. Plus the insects do not land on the skin that is covered with the product.","[""design"",""performance""]"
Insect Repellent,Avon. Works great,"[""performance""]"
Insect Repellent,"Awful.. Awful, watery ""lotion*. It was supposed to be a lotion, not water???<br />Also, keeps 0 bugs abay. Gave me skin rash.  Don't even bother.","[""performance"",""quality""]"
Insect Repellent,"Best bug protection ever!. Best bug repellent, and has a sunscreen built in!  I wear this when doing yard work in north Texas.  Keeps away every bug imaginable, and they all live in my yard. :)  No bites when I wear it, and no sunburn.  Plus it smells great!","[""performance"",""quality""]"
Insect Repellent,Over priced. Very disappointed in this seller/price. I paid $9 plus shipping for this small bottle. I paid $4 for the green bottle and $5 for the off spray at Walmart. I ordered it for my newborn baby since we are traveling to africa. The seal was very difficult to remove. I just hope it repels against mosquitoes and malaria for this expensive price!,"[""design"",""value""]"
Water Filter,Four Stars. Perfect replacement for my GE Profiles fridge.,"[""performance""]"
Water Filter,Four Stars. works great for us,"[""performance""]"
Water Filter,"Hard to find an NSF 42/53 certified alternative. These filters are expensive, but it's hard to find any off brand filters that are both NSF 42 and 53 certified.","[""value""]"
Water Filter,"I think it Might be fake. I read the reviews and therefore was cautious, I got it and it just didn't seem right, not the size, not the colors , not the box it came in... Decided I am not going to risk it, especially since we also use this water to make baby bottles, returned it, and went to get a genuine one from a local store","[""quality""]"
Water Filter,It either works or it doesn't. I don't know how this would get 5 stars. It is one of the dumb things you need for the refrigerator and it works.  Cheaper than buying in store,"[""value""]"
Water Filter,... seem to work well and maked the water taste funny.. Although the product had the right markings indicating it was made by GE the product doesn't seem to work well and maked the water taste funny.,"[""performance""]"
Water Filter,Overpriced. Overpriced... I was stupid and didn't research... You should be able to find this type of filter for $30 or under.,"[""value""]"
Water Filter,"Overpriced, Go with one of the Replacement Brands. Don't waste your money.  For this price order 2 of the bargain filters and get the same result.","[""value""]"
Water Filter,"I guess.... You know, I can't tell the taste difference between this and a generic one (I've only used the HDX Home Depot brand).  It works okay I guess.  I hate the price of these things.","[""value""]"
Water Filter,Great filter but costly!. Easy to remove and instal. The water tastes fine my only issue is they are pricey even when you shop around. I gave it 4 stars due to the high cost otherwise this is a 5 start product.,"[""design"",""performance"",""value""]"

Logitech Mouse,"Best mouse ever!. If you have never tried a ""ball"" mouse--you should try it.  Took a bit getting used to but I love it!  You don't have to ""roll"" your mouse all around to get the pointer on something--you just need to roll the ball.  Reacts quick and precise!","[""performance""]"
Logitech Mouse,"Cheaply made. Had higher expectations. Weak, loose, noisy. The roller ball is a distraction instead of an asset. Trying for years to replace a Microsoft Trac-ball. This is a swing and a miss.","[""performance"",""value""]"
Logitech Mouse,"Great mouse for the price. My wrist stopped hurting after I bought this mouse (Oct 2017).  It just pooped out on me, so I got 1.5 years out of it.  Not bad for the price!","[""performance"",""value""]"
Logitech Mouse,"Great mouse!. I love this mouse, it’s much easier to game with and easier to cover your hand to keep it warm if you have bad circulation.<br /><br />I’ve been using it for years and my little brother has one too - he also loves it.","[""performance""]"
Logitech Mouse,"Great when it works, doesn't work for long. Pretty unreliable. I've ordered three of these, and I think the longest I've had one last so far is about eight months. The last one I ordered only lasted three months. It's really a shame that nobody makes reliable trackball devices anymore.","[""quality""]"
Logitech Mouse,Not near as good as it should be. Not near as smooth as other mise from Logitech have been. The scroll wheel is a bit jurky and noisy. I was hoping for better than it is. It will do for now. Come on Logitech your or you were so much better than this,"[""quality""]"
Logitech Mouse,"Logitech M570 FAILURE to connect to PC!. Logitech Wireless Trackball M570 will NOT pair or connect with  Logitech USB dongle anymore...:-(<br />Have uninstalled/reinstalled Logitech SetPoint software MANY times, but this Logitech M570 does not EVER connect!<br /><br />Please advise, it &#34;used&#34; to work well, on another PC!!!","[""performance""]"
Logitech Mouse,"Too big for my hand!. It is too big for my hand, and I am having a hard time with the sensitivity (or lack thereof), especially in video gaming.","[""design""]"
Logitech Mouse,BEST PRODUCTS TERRIBLE SUPPORT. HAD TO RETURN IT. Could not get it to setup. Have four of them. but they don't seem to last long and the support is terrible to non-existent. That's it in a nutshell.<br />purchased another one.,"[""quality""]"

Glycerin,Five Stars. Use this in my bubble bars and it works great!,"[""performance""]"
Glycerin,Five Stars. Works as advertised,"[""performance""]"
Glycerin,Leaks and doesn't work in food recipes. I was never able to get proper use out of this product. I had found it included in several protein related recipes and decided to buy it but the recipe didn't list a brand. This was definitely not the right brand. It also leaked all over the bottle.,"[""design"",""performance""]"
Glycerin,"Not what is pictured!. I bought this glycerin because it was *supposed* to be Essential Depot brand. Instead I got the glycerin with the red, white, and blue label.<br /><br />I expect to receive what is in the picture. I will send a note to Essential Depot informing them of the switch.<br /><br />I ain't very happy right now.","[""none""]"
Glycerin,"Two Stars. Made with palm oil, didn't realize this before purchasing.","[""non-review""]"
Glycerin,Yes. Yes,"[""non-review""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Doesn't stick to textured surface!!. Good enough for under $10. Cheaply made for sure. My shower floor is textured so this just slides around and won't stick. I hold it against the wall with the opposite foot to use it. Not easy but doable. The bristles already look worn and I've used it once.,"[""performance"",""quality"",""value""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,Excellent product!. I really am barefoot 99% of the time. This is my second one of these and I love it. Gets the garden mud off my feet and feels good too!,"[""performance""]"

Foot Scrubber / Massager,"One Star. save your money, does not stick to shower floor.","[""performance""]"
Foot Scrubber / Massager,"easy feet. I do not recommend this product.  There is no ""well"" for the soap, the suction cups do not stick to my tile and the pumice stone arrived broken.  All-in-all, not a good $25 investment.","[""design"",""performance"",""quality"",""value""]"

Smart Scale,"TERRIBLE!! Inaccurate. TERRIBLE!! Inaccurate. Body fat % is a JOKE, my physician says I am 10% and this registered me as 20%!!! DO NOT waste your money, I returned mine.","[""performance""]"
Smart Scale,Should be better for the Price. This should be way more accurate for the money aslo disappointed with the WiFi signal I have to be nearly right next to my router for it to work...,"[""performance"",""value""]"
Smart Scale,Bad bad bad bad bad. Fitbit aria is a POS. It will fluctuate 4 pounds in back to back readings. My body fat percentage changed a whole 5% in two back to back readings. The data won’t sync with apple HealthKit. What a disaster for an expensive scale. I’m purchasing a $30 wireless scale with better reviews. I’m over FitBit. Y’all stink.,"[""performance""]"
Smart Scale,Noope. The scale is inconsistant and does not correctly measure weight. It has also weighed me as a &#34;guest&#34; on several occassions.,"[""performance""]"
Smart Scale,"great - until it stops working properly.. Blargh. I used to LOVE this scale, until like others have mentioned, it just decided to stop working. It's almost like one of the feet gets stuck or something, causing it to not function properly and the batteries drain in a few days. I had it about a year before this happened - so frustrating. Before that I liked it. :(","[""quality""]"
