'Tis the season for dry hands! I go through a lot of hand creams in the winter months. This lotion is not too thick, but it's not runny either. It absorbs nicely and doesn't leave behind any greasiness. It has a light, fruity scent that's not overpowering. In fact, I found it to be barely noticeable. It is very moisturizing and leaves my hands soft. I would order this again.

7 year old boy broke it in less than 2 months even with the bumper guard on. Won't power up. When it WAS working, very limited on storage. Ran out of space in 1 hour, so the wifi wouldn't work.

Amazon fire is a good tablet if you like e-books. It's also nice to get a six-month subscription to the Washington Post. Their claim to have 16 gigabytes of storage is misleading because it only gives you 5 and then they want to charge you the same amount of money that you paid for the tablet for unlimited storage. Another problem is that you can't flag something as being inappropriate like you can on Samsung Galaxy tablets.

As mentioned in another review, I purchased my son a netbook (to replace his broken Mac). Anyway, I was concerned with the size of his netbook to properly do school work. So, I bought a mouse and also got this Logitech compact keyboard. It is absolutely perfect for this use. A great compact size to work on his desktop. I use the netbook with a monitor, mouse, docking station and this keyboard and you would never know he wasn't working from a full size set up. He loves the number pad on the keyboard (something he missed on the netbook). I would definitely recommend this keyboard for anyone in the market for a new one. It's compact, but has everything you need. The 'action' is great, it's lightweight, I can't say enough good things about it!

At first when I saw this, I wasn't sure what this. I looked at the reviews (which were mostly positive) and thought I would give it a try. My skepticism was quickly diminished after trying this for just a few days. I typically shower every morning and I have Vitamin C and Retinol that I apply to my face. So, when I got this I put it in the freezer and followed the instructions. So, instead of just applying the serums to my face, I started using this roller along with the serums. After less than a week I noticed much less puffiness around my eyes (and I am prone to that area to have bags and puffiness). I also noticed my skin looking noticeably better overall. I think applying this roller to my skin allows the pores to absorb the serums faster and deeper. I will continue to use this going forward. I am really impressed with the results!

Batteries just don't have the strength or long run time. Read all the possitive and negative comments before I bought and they are true.These batteries are good to poor in performance. They start good and quickly drain down to poor. Under heavy load they drain very quickly, will come back with a rest but drain faster each time. Dont use in equipment that have a heavy demand. Clocks would be ok. Expect 1/2 the performance of the leading brands.

Battery drains quite quickly when left inside several other products I had when unused. Not sure if its cheaper than the store, but the quality is not as good as Duracell if I remember correctly. Other than that, getting it as an add on item is great because it allows me to use my products right when I get them without having to worry about making a quick trip to the store

A bit slower than rated, but still should be sufficient for PS5 usage. I've had 0 issues so far.<br />The PRICE IS UNBEATABLE.<br />Let's hope the longevity doesn't match the price.

BETTER THAN NOTHING, But not as good as the CASE LOGIC: ELS-111 11 Chromebook/Surface 3 Sleeve. Fits the MacAir 11.6 perfect. The Amazon sleeve is simply neoprene, which snags and has so much friction, it doesn't easily slide in/out of my backpack. The Amazon quality is decent, but looks like a beer can cozy (koozie) compared to the CASE LOGIC. The CASE LOGIC IS NOT just NEOPRENE! It is highly protective, light, low density foam encased in canvas. It's more durable and slide in and out of my backpack better. Also the CASE LOGIC opens on two sides not just a slit on one side like the Amazon.(I bought both, and tried to return the AmazonBasics, yet Amazon was going to charge me 8.34 to send it back.. so i am keeping it.. Don't waste your time.. Don't make my mistake, buy the CASE LOGIC ELS-111 11 (note: last photo of Case Logic sleeve)

Bought these because I had heard from several sources that alkaline batteries are one of those items that you can buy as generics and get comparable quality to name brands. It is not unusual for me to keep batteries in storage for more than a year without a problem with leakage. These, after a year, would begin leaking soon after installing them. That is, they come out of their protective wrap looking brand new but would leak within days. They fouled up a few things, one of which was a good work flashlight. I hadn't seen a battery leak in decades. I had to throw out the remaining ones even though they looked deceptively good.

Bought these for my husband. They have a good grip and were easy to hold onto. I also likes that they have a larger clip area as your toenails are larger than your finger tips, general speaking. They are heavy and sharp. I feel as though they will last for some to come. I never hesitate to update my reviews if new info should seem useful. They arrived quickly (I have prime) and in good condition along with a few other things I had ordered.

Camera mounting kit. Husband reports it works perfectly for his application. It is white and plastic. Easy to install. Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so, to give you a little more info about me, I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer. I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6,000 reviews posted, those reviews have been viewed well over 50,000 times, including well over 25,000 likes. Bottom line, I pay for all my stuff, just like you do.

Can't really give a full review since the Kindle Fire seemed to work properly, however, the security, Webroot Anywhere, that was included was impossible to install. I tried calling Geek Squad 4 times for support and was disconnected EVERY time. I finally went to store for instructions which they printed off but still would not download. I've ended up buying an iPad which is fantastic and would not buy again from BestBuy.

Compact travel adapter, nice to carry with you on your journeys. I travel quite often to European countries and this adapter will work in every country I will be visiting. No need to have a more clunky model or multiple adapters in your house, this unit will work in over 100 countries. Highly recommend as a way to ease your travel, just keep it in your suitcase at all times so you always have it with you.

ehh...they run out of charge very quickly....its honestly bad for the environment. they do seem to be a bargain but a brand name might come in a smaller quantity but will last longer than these..update 1: these batteries pack's have 50 working(short term) and 50 non-working batteries...I brought multiple battery packs and all have batteries that don't work.In my estimation, i think these batteries are not worth it.

Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model. Check out the two photos.

For the price and quantity I was sure this would be a great buy. Sadly, not all of the batteries worked. I first thought the camcorder we purchased was defective but when I swapped out the fresh, new batteries for a second round of fresh, new batteries from the same package the device magically came to life.

Good price, effective, refillable. I use these for soft scrubbing cleaning. Keep one in the kitchen and each bathroom. I purchase the bulk bag of baking soda to refill the shakers. A great companion purchase. Add a little vinegar to the sink or whatever you are cleaning with baking soda for a disinfecting property. All natural. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. And I hope this info was helpful to you!

Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad.

Great pre and post workout mix. Yes, it has aspartane but then again, the last thing I want in my diet is more sugar. I thought the taste was a little sweet, so I did dilute this more than the recommended mixture (you will probably need to do the same depending on your taste). High in electrolytes and protein, this is great for my Florida workouts with the heat and humidity (and I lose more water sweating than in probably any other area of the country). I was previously a Gatorade drinker, but I honestly prefer this Science in Sport and will be buying more.

Hi,I ordered this for my daughter who has an extensive liking of tablets. She didnt like it because of lack of google play services and she didnt have the patience to work with it. I knew that the os is only amazon specific but despite the apps that can be downloaded, she was disappointed. I returned it.If you are an avid amazon person, the tablet works great, if you want a google tablet, this isn't for you. I would recommend these for people that want a good decent tablet that they can read and use amazon apps on.

Hoped this Fire HD 8 would be faster than my old HD Fire...not so much, I guess I expected the new Fire HD 8 to perform better but it still lags and is slow to load information while surfing the Internet. My wife's Ipad is light years ahead on this one, but what do you expect from a 60-70 dollar tablet.

Husband is type 2 diabetic and with the combo of meds he takes, occasionally low blood sugar is a thing. These are easy and measured. He really likes the grape taste, but lets face it, they are really an emergency fix - so taste makes it easier to get down - which is what is most important. The travel tube is very handy.

I am all about Amazon Basics but I have ordered several of these for our baby toys and they don't compare at all to the Duracell ProCell that I normally order. Would love to go for a great generic brand but this just isn't it. I've been through several of these and they are consistently much faster to run out than the ProCells.

I am enjoying this face cream. I find it to be luxurious. It's nice and creamy. The glass jar is very nice. It smells wonderful. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I've been using it at nighttime because it is a heavier cream. I haven't noticed any miraculous results, but I am a regular user of anti-aging products, so I like to think that this is just continuing what's already going on.

I am in my late 40's and can't see up close without my reading glasses. I recently purchased a vanity mirror for my bathroom with 5x magnification. I was horrified with what I saw! The wrinkles didn't bother me - that goes along with age. But I have lots of blackheads on my temples! I couldn't see them before. I have used the acne tools - the ones that look like dental tools and they work okay, but those often leave behind temporary redness. And you have to be precise about the location because of the small tips. I found this ultrasonic cordless skin scrubber to be much more effective at getting rid of the blackheads! And it doesn't leave behind any redness! The end of it is about an inch and a half wide and it is able to scrape out the ugly blackheads. You can see the dirt and grime on the tip after you've used it. Gross! Now as far as the scrubber goes, it comes with a charger. Once it is on, it has a vibration thing going on. It heats up a little bit, but not to the point where it is too hot to use or it burns. I just can feel a little heat from it while it is in use. There's a silicone cover to go over the metal end when it is not in use. I am thrilled to have found this!<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.

I am very happy with this Micro SD. I could tell the difference in the response time in my BB curve as well as my Asus tablet. If you want something that can transfer files Photos, Videos, and Music faster this is the Micro SD card for you. Now I will say this there are faster cards out there but not at this price. This does the trick for my devices. Now it you are a Professional Photographer you might want to go with the Ultra 3 Micro SD but if you are an everyday user this will work wonders for you device.

I bought 2 Amazon Kid's Fire Tablets for my two grandsons for Christmas. Included in the purchase of the A.K.F. Tablets is a one year subscription to KID's Free Time.I have called & emailed inquiring about the registration process in order for my daughter to activate & begin using the free one year subscription of KID's FREE TIME, & still no resolution.Upon trying to register tablets, credit card used to purchase is required. I do not understand why my credit card needs to be submitted in order to obtain/activate a service that is included in the already PREPAID Purchase!I have been waiting for a response since Christmas.Therefore, at this time, I would have to give a 2 star rating due to the lack of customer service available for this product. With hope of getting this issue resolved I would still recommend to a friend.

I bought 2 of the Amazon Fire tablets because the sales guy said that they were great and ran really fast. I have very fast internet and this thing just barely chugs along. If you play a game, it constantly stalls and freezes. The sound quality when I play music is terrible. I was planning on buying one for each of my 9 nieces and nephews if they ran well but now I know that wouldn't work for them because they are horrible.

Using Duracell batteries I get roughly 20+ hours out of 2 AA.With these Amazon ones, after about 6-7 hours I start getting low battery notices, and unlike the Duracell that I get a few warnings with, I only get one shortly before losing all power. Stick with the name brands, I tried these generic ones and regret it.

I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved.

I bought this to replace a 3-year old Kindle Fire 7"" HDX that I had just dropped on the floor. I sort of panicked, so after doing a couple of hours of research I picked this tablet. Just to be on the safe side I got 16 additional GB of memory. I installed a couple of games (none of them memory hogs) and a cookbook app, in addition to downloading a couple of books and dictionaries. I can honestly say this is the slowest tablet I've ever had. Just rotating the screen takes 7-10 seconds, and that's if there's only one app open. Opening a book or magazine can take half a minute, and God help you if you want to switch between a recipe and a magazine while you're cooking! Amazon is obviously more concerned about showing you constant special offers and apps than having satisfied customers. Since there are no other Fire tablets available for whatever reason (maybe they're being discontinued?) I'll be replacing it with either an iPad or a Galaxy tablet.

I didnt like it from the begining because it isnt very ergomatic. It was easy to hit the wrong button shocking your dog when it was last set to vibrate. It was veru easy to push buttuns so you cant put it in a pocket. Then a week into use while replacing a probe, I hand turned to tighten it and the prope broke with the scew end broke off level and no way to get it out. I bought a product that had a different control style (so many manufators use the same controler design) and i hsve no problems with handling this one. Another problem is that the reciever can be shook off the collar the more it is worn. We lost the reciever after a few weeks. It might be ok if your dog is a fast learner and plan to use it for just a few days.

I don't have a lot of problems sleeping, but when I do, it's very frustrating! Last night I was awakened by an emergency alert on my phone. I was unable to fall asleep afterwards. After about an hour, I decided to try one of these supplements and it worked very well. I was able to fall asleep again. In the morning, I felt just fine. I didn't feel sluggish or tired. I usually take Tylenol PM or something like that and only on the 2nd night of having sleep problems. I will definitely use this instead of the Tylenol PM next time I need something to help me sleep!

I don't know why but these things don't last long. Maybe I don't know anything about batteries and there is certain number I should be looking for to determine the life span.

I get Keratin treatments at the salon at least 3-4 times a year (would do it more often if I could afford it). I am always in the market to use products that can help extend my salon visits. This Keratin shampoo is really nice. It is sulfate free (which is the first thing I look for ) and makes my hair feel silky smooth and soft. I highly recommend for anyone who wants to improve the texture and appearance of your hair. I really like the fragrance, too.

I had never tried anything for my skin consisting of pomegranate, so I was anxious to try this. It actually is an entire skin care regimine containing a cleanser, a toner, a facial cream, an eye cream and overall moisurizers. I actually was quite surprised how well this worked from start to finish. It was nice having an entire skin care routine in one package (instead of me working with various separate products. Fragrance is light and smells almost apple-like (but very light). I particularly like the cleanser and the toner. It also comes in a beautiful gift box so this would make a wonderful gift for someone. I bought another for my mother-in-law and plan to give it to her when we visit next month. Highly recommend!

I have a mild form of IBS and have been taking probiotics (in pill form) for years now. I thought I would try something different by using a chewable variety and I was thrilled when I saw this. I was a little skeptical with the title of 'Dark Chocolate' and it brought back memories as a kid of chocolate Ex-lax flavoring. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised! The flavor of this chewable probiotic is absolutely amazing. It actually makes me look forward to taking my daily probiotic to help keep my IBS in check. Since taking this, I do feel better and my bloating issues have definitely decrease. As we all know probiotics are good bacteria and everyone (even without IBS issues) should be taking probiotics daily just to help your digestive system perform optimally. If you are looking for a type of probiotic that you can actually like taking, and you love chocolate, this Digestive Advantage Dark Chocolate will definitey fill the bill!

I have been looking for storage for my make up brushes. I've been keeping them in some cardboard desk organizer boxes, so this is a huge improvement! The acrylic is quite thick. I have other acrylic make up organizers and not all of them are this thick. The wells are deep enough that make up brushes won't fall out. I once ordered an acrylic organizer geared toward brush storage, but the compartments were so shallow, that my brushes wouldn't stand up in it. I ended up using it for something else instead of storing my brushes. I'm not sure what I will use the smaller well for. It looks like it was designed to hold business cards. I'm sure I'll come up with something! I am very pleased with the quality of this organizer. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't hold all of my brushes! Or maybe I just have too many!<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest & unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.

I have found that a large percentage of these batteries only last about half as long as Duracell. I had assumed that since Amazon doesn't own a battery factory, that these are simply a major brand that is private labeled. So I assumed they would last just as long. My TV remote came with a Sony battery, it lasted a year. I replaced it with one of these and it only lasted 5 months.

I have high blood pressure. I have a wrist monitor, but I wanted a full size one. This one has a large, easy to read display. It seems to be pretty accurate. I am on medication for my hypertension and my results from it seem to be as expected. Batteries are included. It also can be charged with a USB C cable (included).

I have never been big on vitamins, with the exception of the occasional multi-vitamin. However, during the pandemic, I started on a daily regimen of taking Vitamin C, Vitamin D3 and Zinc every morning and an additional Vitamin C at night. This is a large bottle of three hundred tablets (enough to last me for three months). I typically take all my vitamins on an empty stomach and I have had no ill side effects from doing so. Everyone should be taking these daily to strengthen your immune system (even if you are vaccinated). Highly recommend!

I have never had problems with the Amazon brand batteries before until this time around. I use these for battery operated candles and normally 3 AAA batteries will last in my candle a couple of weeks on a timer. I replaced the batteries 2 days ago with these batteries in 3 separate candles and all three candles do not work less than 24 hours later. Not sure if this batch was defective or not, but I won't risk spending the money and buying them again to not have them work.

It isn't made well. I am going to return it and I will probably never buy another kindle . HORRIBLE

I have to say this was not that great a purchase and we will most likely be taking advantage of it's greatest product feature, which is the ability to return it for a full refund. We wanted a smaller tablet for our kids, well this is smaller in every way, options are limited and we have realized that we are better off just letting the kids use our tablet so we can buy the newest one.

I have tried a few similar silicone face mask brackets and I feel that these really are the best! What makes them stand apart from the rest is the silicone strap. Basically, you are wearing 2 separate things - the bracket and your mask. After nearly a year of wearing masks, I have found these to be the most helpful when it comes to preventing my glasses to fog up. The silicone is very soft and non-irritating. The storage cases are an added bonus in my opinion. Love these!

I have tried several different brands of face wipes. These have to be some of the best ones that I have ever used. They have a wonderful, refreshing scent to them. They are wetter than most wipes I have used which makes them more effective at cleansing the face. The cloths are a good size and pretty soft. They didn't irritate my sensitive skin. The package did rip as I was trying to remove the open sticker, so I have put them inside a plastic baggie so they don't dry out prematurely.

I have used these batteries in several items from flashlights to toys. I have found them less than adaquate for the items they were used in. In my flashlights, I have found they last with average use about 3 weeks. Not very good. For controllers like TV remotes, they last less than a month. They may be cheper in the short run but they become much more expensive in the long run. I will not buy them again and suggest paying a bit more and getting the name brand batteries.

I just turned fifty recently and have been taking multi-vitamins for the last several years. This one is a large, &#34;horse pill&#34; type vitamin, but I haven't had any problems swallowing them. They don't upset my stomach nor do they cause my urine to be bright yellow. I love that it comes with enough servings for about two months. I have noticed that I am not as tired in the afternoons as I usually am which I am attributing to these. They seem to be a good, basic vitamin.

I like AmazonBasics products, so I was excited to see these batteries. To find out if they were a good value, I looked up data online. Bottom line:-- For flashlights, toys, and steady drain devices, you'll be better off buying Rayovac Alkalines here on Amazon.-- For cameras and photo flashes, Duracell Coppertops will be better.Here's why: Rayovacs cost a little bit more per battery, but they hold more energy than these AmazonBasics batteries. As a result, the final price per amount of power is about the same. You just won't have to change batteries as often.Those Rayovacs work best in steady drain devices, but not so well in cameras or flashes. For those high drain devices, Duracell Coppertops hold up better and end up being cheaper.Battery Ninja tested these AmazonBasics AA's in toothbrushes I did some calculations and found that these batteries offer a reasonable price per unit of power (mWh), but that they do not carry as much energy as others. The test results show that these batteries will run out faster than others, at least in the toothbrushes. There were no test results vs. digital cameras, photo flashes, or toys, so I'm extrapolating that these will perform like Rayovacs, not like Duracell Coppertops.So, the only data to compare here is the toothbrush test. For energy delivered, these AmazonBasics batteries cost about the same as Rayovac batteries but will die sooner. To say that another way, these batteries cost less, but also deliver less power.Both Rayovac and Amazon Basics are better than Energizer batteries, which appear to consistently give less power and still cost more. I guess the money goes to the Energizer Bunny.Duracell Coppertops will last longer in flashlights, toys, and toothbrushes, but cost a little bit more per unit of power (mWh). On the other hand, they hold up better in cameras and similar electronics. They're probably the best all around battery. So, if you don't like changing batteries and a willing to spend a tiny bit more, Coppertops are a good way to go.Finally, the best value battery is interesting: it is the Costco Kirkland Signature. Battery Ninja's results show that and so do the tests from Consumer Reports. You can buy those Costco batteries here on Amazon, but the price is higher than you'd get at the club. Of course, I'm not a Costco member, so it doesn't matter to me... but buying them here on Amazon is not a good value.

I like shopping with Amazon and have purchased several Amazon brand products. However, I would not recommend anyone buy these batteries. I opened up the box and took a pack of four batteries out of the case and one was leaking. I threw those away. I need batteries for one of my sons toys so opened up another pack and put the batteries in and you guessed it, there was no charge in the batteries at all. About half of the batteries in the box were dead on arrival. The other ones had a charge but did not last long. Save your self the headache and buy energizers or something else. You will pay more but they work. I tried to return this pack but I was out of the 30 day window to return so I'm out the money.

I live in Florida where hard water is definitely an issue. I just purchased my house last September, and recently retired, and I am trying to be careful on spending money. Many of my neighbors have been installing whole house water systems and although I do think at sometime in the future I will look into it, this filter has helped me at least in the shower. I can tell the water is better since I installed it (yes, installation was super easy for me) and my hair feels so much softer and I see less spots on the shower glass doors. For the money, this is a great shower filter and I highly recommend it.

I love this combo package, particularly the flosser. This makes a great gift package for someone you love, giving them everything they need to keep their mouth/gum health optimal. I have had issues (particularly gums) for the past 5 years. No ones fault but my own for not taking care of my mouth the way I should have all these years. This flosser is great. I fill it with Act Restoring mouthwash and use it after brushing. It amazes me how much stuff this flosser removes with a simple puff of air. Of course, you can purchase both these items separately, but you save in getting them together. Sonicare makes the best tooth/gum care products on the market bar none!

I Ordered these to use in my flashes to shoot a wedding. They are with out a doubt the worst batteries I've ever used. They'd last for maybe 30 to 40 shots, and they would start to over heat. I have to dump then into my shirt instead of my hand they were so hot, they would burn you.Typically I can run though a wedding with energizer batters (4 AA) and only have to swap batteries once. I went through this entire pack, and had to go buy more at a store. Which the ones I bought later caused no issues and finished out the night.Very displeased and glad they did not destroy my equipment and blow up like many have had issues with. I will never buy these again.

I ordered this for my new Samsung Galaxy note II, and it works awesome! Installed it, and had no problems. I loaded all my music on it, and didn't even scratch the surface of the capacity of this card! I shouldn't ever have to worry about running outta room with this card. Highly recommended for any smartphone user!

I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either. So I'm returning this; hopefully can find an Android tablet I like (and affordable) at Best Buy.

I purchased my Kindle2 in March of 09 - and it came with this adapter and cord. It is now October 09, and the small part of the adapter for this cord has stopped working. Fortunately, I was able to plug the CORD part into my laptop's USB port, and charge the Kindle that way. While plugged into a wall socket using Amazon's adapter, it does not charge at all (no light, no charge, no nothin'). I tried using the USB/Power adapter for my iPod, but the charge light blinked intermittently, and it seemed to drain the Kindle's battery. I have only had this for 9 months. I think the adapter should last longer than that. Preferably, Amazon could/should have come up with an interface that allows the use of adapters we already have - like for our phones or iPods. It's not rocket science... but it IS marketing. I came online to purchase the replacement, but I'm not sure I want to buy the same thing.... I have both the original Kindle and the Kindle2, and I love the product, but with this adapter, I have to ask.... Why

I purchased my Voyage yesterday. It looked like I scratched the screen today and I contacted Amazon directly and they replaced my Voyage under the warentee I did not need to go thru bestbuy. Turns out it was food and not a scratch and canceled the replacement but point is Amazon backs up their products! I do not think its worth 199$ for there is a weird screen discoloration where the top appears orangeish and the bottom blueish but only under certain lighting conditions BUT its barely noticeable. In normal light it looks quite normal. Due to cost it will be a great first purchase but no real need to upgrade from paperwhite BUT in its defense the Voyage is much much lighter, thinner and more responsive and the page turn buttons are seamless. Over all this is a mighty nice product. Side note: I own a Nook glow-light plus which is cheaper and looks nicer and has a great feel to it as well. Nook glowlight plus is more stylish with the copperish color back and white textured front. The Voyage is attractive too BUT I think it will sell better if it had a "" two toned"" color Like maybe a white front and a colored back side. Voyage is much faster than the nook but prettymuch same features. I just feel Amazon can afford to make their product more stylish. Also best buy does not seem to offer and real choices for cases on their kindles and tablets. I had to order a cover at ebay.

I purchased the AA batteries for my Nest smoke detectors. The batteries that came with the Nest lasted for a couple of years, so I expected similar performance from the Amazon AA's. In less than 2 months after my purchase, the Nest indicated that they had to be replaced again. This product is not to Amazon's expected standards. I will give it a miss.

I purchased the Kindle Oasis because I was growing increasingly tired of the glare and cumbersome size of reading off my iPad. So the portability is great. And of course, I went for the most expensive, because I wanted the extra battery life. And while the length of time it stays charged is nice, charges very quickly, it's still overpriced. I love the non-glare screen, you can literally read this anywhere. But the wifi connectivity is patchy at best. I have to go upstairs in my home and stand close to the router for the Oasis to connect, this is very annoying. Wouldn't be a big deal if I only read from this one device. But I read from another and picking up where I left off is a pain most times. Non of my issues are really a big deal, but for $300 I don't feel like I should have any issues.

I purchased them thinking they would be a great value, based on other reviews. I have an alarm keypad (among other things) that I use them in. Previously batteries would last about a year in the keypad. These batteries will last about a month before they die. The first time it happened, I thought there could have been a bad battery or possibly my memory was failing me. After 3 sets in 3 months, there is no doubt. The batteries test fully charged when I install them and then a month later they are gone. That is not a great value at all. I will find another battery for future use.

I realized after purchasing that the reason you get so many for such great price is because it takes the entire box to equate to one 12 pack of more expensive batteries. The life on these is terrible! I've used them in everything from remote controls to kid toys and they run out VERY fast. Go ahead and spend the extra money for a better quality battery.

I recently bought these to use in my Streamlight Microstream flashlight. I've carried one every day for the past 4 years and I love them. I say them because I'm on my 6th one maybe. It's my fault, really. I lose them very easily for some reason. Anyway, these batteries are average at best. I generally get copper tops or energizers and was looking for an economical equivalent. This isn't it. I find myself replacing the battery in my flashlight more often than I used to. These batteries might be ok for your tv remote or battery powered clock but I'd pass if you need them for anything you rely on.

I recently purchased some lather cream for my husband as an alternative to his usual shaving cream. So when I was offered a coupon for a shaving brush, I jumped at the chance to get one so he could properly use his lather cream. He's been using his new shaving brush for a couple of weeks now and so far, so good. First of all, I was impressed with the packaging. It came in a nice box which would be excellent for gift giving. The handle is sturdy & fits nicely in your hand. The beaver hair is surprisingly soft. My husband is pleased with the lathering that the brush produces. The brush did have some shedding at first, but as the description states, that's normal and after those first few hairs, my husband hasn't noticed any more shedding. My husband has never used a lather brush before, so he doesn't have anything to compare it to, but it appears to be doing a good job and he's pleased with it.

I replaced my older Kindle Keyboard, which is larger and heavier than this kindle. Page turning takes some getting used to - I keep touching screen and turning page by mistake. You're able to turn the ""side buttons"" page turning off, but can't turn the touchscreen page turning off - it sure would be nice to allow page turns only with the ""side buttons"" - I think this is a major design flaw. Also, the audio option seems to be missing - you can't have books read aloud to you anymore. Also, no 3G. I almost returned this, but didn't get around to it, so I'm stuck with it.

I thought that this was a great deal, but the batteries don't seem to last very long. I feel like I am constantly having to change the batteries in my remote. I would equate these to being a little bit better than dollar store batteries, but they are not of the highest quality.

I use these for my wireless mouse on my laptop. Not heavy use at all. But I am replacing these batteries at least once a week. I have to carry extra batteries with me, and I've never done that before. I used to go MONTHS with name brand batteries, so it's a dramatic difference. I'll use these up but I won't buy them again.That being said, this is the worst Amazon Basics product that I have bought. Everything else has been outstanding, so I'm really surprised at how bad these are.I have the AAs as well, and those don't seem to have the same problem. Maybe these are just part of a bad batch

I used these to replace the batteries in my digital safe. A week or two later I needed to access something from the safe, but it wouldn't open. I was sure I was entering the right code, but the safe just beeped and didn't unlock. I didn't suspect the batteries right away because they were still almost new. But eventually I plugged in a different brand and that's all it took the get the safe to work properly again. It was a big relief, and interesting to find out that AA batteries aren't all created equal.

I was excited to expand more into the AmazonBasics brand since all previous purchases have been very well received. However, these batteries were not optimal for devices that are constantly on. We used them in gaming controllers for XBox and each set of 2 would make it about 1 day of constant family gaming/TV usage.It's very possible we received a bad batch but due to going through the entire pack in just 2 weeks compared to other brands I will have to steer clear from these in the future.

I was initially excited to get the Kindle. I am extremely disappointed with all the ads. Even more disappointed to find out that I could pay Amazon more money to remove the ads. It's frustrating that Best Buy and more specifically Amazon, don't let the consumer know on the box or in store advertising that what you're buying is a mini advertising billboard. Why couldn't there be an upfront statement on the box or in the store stating that the ""low price"" is subsidized by all the ads on the device? Would this have changed my purchase? Absolutely!!!! I would have spent a couple bucks more and probably got a Samsung tablet.

I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.

I was really excited to find a great deal on batteries. I would have to say if you just used these batteries for remote controls. And basic stuff then this would be the battery pick hands down. I could not believe how many batteries I went through for a child's toy. These batteries don't hold there ground against brand name. I burnt through 24 amazon batteries in one month on my son's hot wheel course. Just basic use maybe an hour a day at most. Brand name has lasted 2 months.

When I went to replace them, none of the unopened ones work! So to recap... they did not last long, and only 8 of them were even usable. Very disappointed as we are big Amazon users.

I will start by saying I have an Omnimount tv mount and when I saw the sound bar mount in Vine, I was very excited to say the least. It is, naturally, a perfect match for wall mounted Panasonic 42"" television in the Omnimount. It was easy to install (so easy, I was able to do it myself, someone who is usually shy of doing any kind of DIY activities. I love the way it fits and it looks like a professional mounting job all around. I highly recommend this sound bar mount (I am using it with my large Bose) especially if you buy it as a companion to the Omnimount television mounting system.

I’ve only used these cups a few times as my husband shares his coffee with me & this cup & amount is perfect.<br />I previously bought another brand that came with a clip on handle and they are okay for store sampling, one time use, but since I could feel the hot coffee, I had to use two.<br />These cups are thicker & sturdier as I’ve used them multiple times since my husband makes 3-5 coffees per day, depending on if we share them and I’ve haven’t had to replace the cup because of multiple uses even if it sat for awhile in between cups.<br />I would definitely recommend and I would definitely rebuy.

If you already have the Amazon Echo system then the Tap is a nice addition. I use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice. There are Bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker. The real advantage is being able to interface with the Echo system as well as item to music, news,etc. I have not used it off it's charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem.

If you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device!It works well. Calendar functions, plays radio, most podcasts, can order Domino's. But you have to be aware that most features require to some degree Amazon Prime membership. For example Spotify will not work unless it is a premium account.

In my opinion it's very slow for internet use. Good for our 5 yr old to use but we purchased this for her to do online curriculums, which is almost impossible to do with this tablet because of the speed. Our internet connection is great with every other laptop and computer in the house.

In my opinion these did not last anywhere near as long as Duracel in things like LED candles (which is crazy) and trail cameras. Cameras were not exposed to cold temps more or less than other batteries. WE buy in bulk for the north house. Amazon Basics is great for things like sheets and beeding and towels. In my opinion the battery life, in the large package of aaa and aa size we purchased were lacking.

In this day and age of excessive hand washing - I HAD to have some of these to save my poor, cracked over washed hands - still have to do the dishes. They are extra long. I consider myself to have a medium size hand and they are snug - but not too. Comes with a set of 3 in 3 different colors -- that happen to work for spring right now - but who really cares. My hands are grateful.

Is it just me, or is it a huge challenge keeping enough batteries on hand. It's easy just to order a bulk box of these rather than take a beating at retail price. I'm not sure they are up to Energizer or Duracell standards, but they do the job ok. No complaints so far.

It's pretty good for what it is designed to do: a portable bluetooth speaker and Alexa-enabled speaker. Not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for Alexa. Nice thing once connected to your Alexa account is that you can play music, whatever, without having your phone nearby though Alexa only works when connected to WiFi. If no Wifi, then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps. Battery life is also pretty good.

Just got this today and have been struggling with a few things. Set up itself was pretty easy right oit of the box. Had no idea I would not have access to Google Play Store. Beware, there is a much more limited selection of apps available for this device. Browsing is slow, even while in the same room with my modem. Much slower than my phone or my other tablet. Tumblr app, though able to be downloaded, malfunctions consistently. Will probably return this and get a more capable tablet, but will give it another couple of days to get used to it before doing so.

Just opened a brand new box of Amazon AAA batteries 100 count . Sorry Amazon, but I had to open several packages of 4 only to discover. That most of the brand new batteries contained in the box arrived DEAD. I put a meter on the batteries to check for voltage. Some read 1v DC some read 0v dc and some read 2. volts. The batteries I removed from my head set were weak but at least had 1 volt As you can see in the photo the freshness date states 12-2026. . I certainly expect to find more dead batteries in that box. I don't have the time to check each package of 4 right now. Not good Amazon. I am concerned, because I purchase your packages of 9 volts and packages of AA as well. will I be surprised and disappointed as well

Just purchased in October and replaced the batteries in my camping lantern this past week using these. The batteries leaked inside the lantern so badly that it wrecked the device altogether. I attempted to clean the contacts and use a different brand batteries, but enough battery acid leaked that the plastic and internals have a permanent coat of oxidation on it. Had to buy a new lantern. Do not plan on purchasing again in future as the batteries are ineligible for a return at this point.

Last less than a quarter as long as even off-brand batteries such as Rayovac, creating a lot more waste. With name brand batteries my wireless keyboard would last almost a year these amazon branded batteries last only 2-3 months. If they weren't considered hazardous waste when spent I might have given them 2 stars on account of there low price, but when you consider how hard it is to dispose of batteries properly (and how much time you'll spend changing them out of your favorite devices) they're really not worth your time

Like DOS, you need to memorize your command and speak it out, otherwise it may not understand your command. Google Assistant is smarter. Also you cant use Spotify free account, to work around you must add a lot of free music to Amazon music into your own amazon music account before you can hear any music. Google home is more convenient this case, as you can start listening to any music channel by your free account from Spotify. If you have paid account for Spotify then not much different here. But to do searching you may be disappointed with this Tap, Google Home is just much smarter. The sound of this Tap is very good indeed, but I return it because it cant do music alarm, also it cant use Spotify for free, also its search is not smart enough, so I switched to Google Home.

Lot's of claims in the description and lots of good reviews here, so I don't know what went wrong, but it appears these batteries really stink.In a TV remote, a pair of these batteries lasted 2 weeks. The name-brand batteries they replaced had lasted several months.In an LED flashlight, a pair of these batteries lasted exactly 2 uses before the light got dim and 3 uses before the batteries were totally dead. I'm talking about, like, less than 10 minutes of cumulative use. The previous batteries had lasted dozens of uses probably at least 3 hours of on-time.I don't know if I got a bad batch (a BIG bad batch of 48), or if I was just tricked into having the wrong expectations. Either way, back to name-brand batteries for me.

Lots of research -<br />Needed a 47 inch HDTV for living room - old style TV shelves built in to include TV position that was too.<br />Based on reviews - caught a quick sales price opportunity and pulled the trigger. So happy with purchase.<br />1. Had to search online for the best picture calibration. Out of the box the picture was not good. Comparing it to our LG 60 plasma.<br />2. Wanted and LED/LCD type TV - but a good picture and price. Our LG plasma has been flawless.<br />3. Wanted a thin TV with a good picture for 3D and wanted it to be passive this time. we have the active 3D downstairs.<br />So far the 8600 has meet our expectations and exceeded some. Once we got the picture calibrated CNET review.... its all been very good.<br />TV is lightweight - we're currently using the TV stand but have plans to mount it on an articulating bracket once we can modify the TV cubby.<br />Remote is their magic remote. our first experience w/ the magic remote was with our plasma (2010), used it twice and stored it.<br />since this was the only remote, had no choice. It was easy to use and get the 8600 updated (firmware), online - Ethernet and change settings for calibration. but since then we only use the remote to turn on the TV since we have DirecTV and use that remote for the channels plus have a Harman Kardon receiver that we use for volume etc. most likely we'll be setting one or both of those up as universal remotes. only make sense.<br /><br />we only used the audio speakers on the 8600 for two weeks, decent sounding but not going to fill the room. we use our Harman Kardon as the workhorse now. once you go HDMI and the receiver the 8600 speakers become inop.<br /><br />the good news - a decently strong person can lift the set by themselves to set it in position or move it to make changes. the picture is good, 3D is decent, not eye popping like active 3D does but good enough for our living room and much cheaper with almost free 3D passive glasses.<br /><br />con - not much we can say.... wish I had got the 55&#34; but the extra few hundred would have put me in the dog house especially when the TV would not have fit inside the tv cubby.

Loved the price but I found myself replacing them more quickly in items like the wall clocks and the remote controls.

Micro usb cable. Oops, I needed a mini! But can use these. Time will tell about longevity. Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so, to give you a little more info about me, I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6,000 reviews posted, viewed over 50,000 times, and over 24,000 likes.

Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire

My 37 days old Amazon fire stick quit working, the system was fine it just seemed like the remote wasn't getting any juice. Tried 3 different sets of these batteries in it and it still wouldn't work-and yes, I put them in the right way. Contacted Amazon about the limited warranty on remote as it was just past 30 days purchased and couldn't return, but before sending back for warranty service and being without TV for who knows how long and just to make sure, I bought some energizer batteries. Wouldn't you know it, the remote fired right back up. Can't trust these batteries.

I had to use the BB warranty to replace it the day after purchase for a fall that the tablet should've been able to handle that is designed for kids.

My 7-year old daughter saved up to by this. Her brother bought the 8GB about a year earlier, so new she needed more space. The OS is a bit clunky, and less intuitive then on higher priced tablets, but tough to beat the price. Speed isn't great for web or certain gaming apps, but fine for books. Parental controls are helpful, but take time to figure out and require more steps than seem necessary to change. Overall, OK first tablet for kids, considering the price. For adults, fine for e-books and VERY basic apps. Otherwise, best to pay up for better quality and OS efficiency.

My husband is a big guy with a beard - further - in my opinion - an unusually large head. So finding washable masks for him as been a real challenge. These masks are really big. Fully cover his nose, face and beard. He really like the comfort of the ear loops which are also part of the ""adjustablity."" I am not a huge fan of the hanging mask (for sanitary reasons - ""don't mess with your mask"" etc) BUT it does keep the mask from being put down - possibly leaving germs on surfaces - and then picking them up again. They are washable - highly important to me. They are simple black. Nothing fancy. The point is, they will work. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. Having said all of that, I just ordered 1/2 a dozen more for him to use.

My son had a MAC which fell and ended up destroying the screen. So, without a computer to bring back to college, we started looking at a replacement. Long story short, with Macs being way to expensive at this economic time, I got him a netbook. Of course, it took some getting used to. One of his his principal complaints was trying to navigate the smaller 10"" netbook. When I saw this Verbatim 96781 Nano Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse I jumped at it. It was small enough that he could leave it plugged into his port without having to disconnect it when he was packing it up to take with him. Given his track record of losing stuff, to me that was a great feature. The ergonomic design of the mouse is not too big or small and fits perfectly for him to use. I know I never see him using the netbook anymore without the wireless mouse, so I know it's a tremendous asset for him. I am in the market now for monitor and maybe even a docking station now, so he will be able to actually set up a desk in his dorm with the netbook. The mouse is perfect for his use, it is economically priced, and I think you will be hard pressed to find something better. I rarely rate items here as a 4 star, but I feel I must with the Verbatim. We are very pleased.

My son loves it. It does have some flaws though. When he closes an app and then tries to open it again sometimes it has to download all over again. Also, even though apps are supposed to work without wifi, apps will load up fine and then we receive an error message saying we have to download the app again although the app is running perfectly in the background without wifi. Eventually all apps will disappear from the screen until we get back to wifi and restart the tablet.

Not a very good battery. They drain really fast. I use them in my Roku remote. I plug my headphones into the remote for wireless listening, so I'm not sure if that is a factor. But I've used several different batteries in the remote and none of them drained nearly as quick as these did. I'm talking a week and they are dead. I would not recommend them.

Not lasting very long. I read the reviews and expected better life out of these batteries. In comparison to Duracell they seem to last about 75 as long. I find that both the AA and AAA are sub-par in longevity. Perhaps that is the way I use them but I really expected more.

Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far.

Every time you need more than four or if you're just going to split up some sets, you have to open a new group of four, and they come wrapped in that horribly annoying cellophane like substance that is hard to remove it must be terrible for the environment.

Pro: Relatively inexpensive, although I did end up waiting almost two weeks for delivery.Cons: High drop-out rate. They come in packs of four when used in Nikon cameras it's not uncommon to find after an hour of use that three of the cells have dropped to 1.48V while the fourth has dropped to...1.2V. They come out of the box within a hundredth of a volt of each other, so I'm guessing that either the electrochemistry is highly variable from cell to cell or there's a interesting failure mode under load.

So I bought my little guys these tablets... so that I could repossess my IPad. Love the free time app but who could've imagined they wouldn't play NETFLIX!! So now... I'm out the money for the tablet and still don't have my iPad back... and yes, I called Amazon numerous times... they work after the fix, but the next time they go to use them they don't work again... the fix takes several minutes as it's force stopping the app, clearing cache then doing a hard restart... then you have to wait to restart Netflix.... oh and sometimes you have to do it numerous times before it works... if it works at all

Sorry Amazon, I love you, but these batteries are terrible. They don't last long at all. Reordered before I realized that they peter out in short order. They have failed in every application requiring batteries. Unfortunately, their made in Indonesia. Wasn't putting them in the China slot immediately but have no choice to do so. Applications referred to are, tooth brush, remote controls, motion lights, etc. Purchased, AAA AA with no difference in performance. I enjoyed the idea of being stocked up on quantity, but the quantity doesn't replace quality. Won't be ordering these batteries again. But will be shopping for a superior product.J.MAC

Sorry Amazon. You guys are great at what you do by selling your products at reasonable prices and good no hassle returns and I am a very happy customer. But I purchased a box each of your AAA, AA, and D Cell batteries. I have used the AAA's for remotes with no apparent problems so far. I have not used the D Cells yet, but the AA batteries are the worst batteries I have ever used. They don't last long in my flash lights. My son had four batteries that actually blew up inside the unit. I heard a loud pop while the unit was playing after five minutes or so. I wanted to know what happened, and looked inside the unit and the green - negative containment ring/sealer had blown out and acid was all over the inside of the unit. I had to throw the rest of these batteries in the trash because I am worried about my little ones getting acid on them. Amazon Your good name should not be on those bad batteries.

The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well.

The Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet no longer was able to charge less than six months after being received as a Christmas present. I contaced Amazon, assuming that the was a one year warranty. Amazon tech support navigated me through a number of trouble shooting steps and concluded that the Usb port is defective. I was then told that this product only has a 90 day warranty and the best they could do in give me a 10% on my next Amazon purchase! Wow!

The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars.

The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!

The longevity of these batteries is nothing special. They do not compare to Duracell or Energizer alkalines. After reading the reviews, I was greatly disappointed. I used them, among others, for a wall clock and remote controller. Their longevity is no better than alkaline batteries marketed and sold by Walgreen's for example. Take this into consideration before you buy them.

The Mountain Falls Ultra Sunscreen is a very affordable alternative to the big name brand sunscreens. The first thing I noticed about this sunscreen, is that the scent is pretty mild. It does have the typical smell that goes along with products containing sunscreen, but it's not very strong at all. In fact, it's barely noticeable when you first open the lid of it. It absorbs pretty quickly into the skin and doesn't leave any greasiness behind. It seems to do a good job of protecting, as long as you remember to reapply it regularly. Every year, I cringe at the prices of sunscreen out there. This is a non-cringe worthy, comparable product.

The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable.

The scale arrived earlier than expected, and came packaged nicely. No visible damage on the box, so I was excited to test it out. The scale came with batteries, which was very convenient. However, upon turning on the scale, I discovered that the entire lower line of the display failed to light up and change (I.E: an 8 looks like an A, 3 looks like a backwards F). Other than that, this scale would have been fantastic. One thing to note, the weighing platform is not silver itself, but rather appears to be a silver plastic.

The specs are good, feels solid, can't stand the OS. Too many ads you can't get rid of, not as customizable as I'd like. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good tablet for the price. Don't expect to run games on it, not powerful enough for that.

The tablet could be great for my 4 year old daughter if it worked properly. As of right now I need to return it to see if a new one will work. There are black and grey lines across the screen most of the time. It will not go to the home screen so my daughter can play on it. I am hoping a new one will not be faulty.

The two guard stops at the bottom are WAY TOO HIGH. They dig into my wrists are are painful after only 5 minutes.Everything else about the stand is excellent for a 13 laptop.

The Voyage, when it worked, was great - the page turns make the reading experience seamless and the ink is crisp, making it a real upgrade from the Paperwhite. That said, it started to freeze up quickly after I got it. Hopefully this is a software issue that will be resolved soon (and the price of early adoption, sometimes), because overall, I couldn't be more pleased with the (working) Voyage.

There is no other subscription box for dogs like Bark Box. The amount of creativity that goes into each box -- from the toys & treats to the packaging -- makes this a treat for humans too, but my big boy Bubba loves it most of all. The treats are high-quality & healthy and he's loved every bag that's come in the Bark Box. The toys are fun & thoughtfully designed by people who obviously know and love dogs. It's a full-on dog party at my house the day the box arrives. Other boxes seem to just throw in stuff that we don't always need or use, but Bubba always needs toys and treats (because he's such a good boy). When we both get excited on Bark Box day, then they must be doing something right.

There is nothing spectacular about this item but also nothing majorly wrong with it. The biggest flaw is that this is geared to kids and there is no way that I have found searching settings or online to lock the touch screen so that a video keeps playing if the child hits the screen. This means lots of times helping get back into the movie or show rather than just relaxing like an iPad can do with guided access activated.

These are by far the WORST batteries I have ever purchased. I have previously purchased bulk batteries from other vendors. When I ran out of the previous batteries I thought would order more. When I saw that these were branded by Amazon I thought I could not lose...WRONG! As an example, when I put these batteries in a thermostat they are dead within a few days. I normally put batteries in this thermostat once a year...not every few days. 2nd Example: I put the batteries in a bluetooth mouse (normally batteries last a few months) and they are dead within a week.I don't know if I have a bad batch or what but they are TERRIBLE. Take this into account before you order.

These are nicely packaged and initially I was impressed - I didn't have to go to the store to buy batteries, they were cheaper than alternatives, and the packaging was great.

These batteries are only OK. They don't last as long as Duracell and when they die, it's usually instantly. One moment they seem to work fine, the very next moment they are outputting half power. I would say that about half of these batteries just simply died while being used, no warning, no gradual loss of power, simply dead. They also seem to be marginally shorter than brand-name batteries, but to be honest, I haven't measured them. Suffice it to say I've decided that I would rather spend the few extra cents per battery on brand-name batteries. It's simply not worth the savings in my opinion. (I've had similar experience with Dollar Store batteries.)

These batteries lasted barely 2 weeks in a low drain device. They actually performed worse than dollar store batteries! I can't believe there are so many positive reviews... maybe I got a bad batch.

They are batteries and they do work... but not for long. I pretty much base battery quality by how long they last in my wireless mouse. Generally I have to replace my home mouse every 5-6 months. I purchased these Amazon Basics AA Performance Alkaline batteries 3-1/2 months ago. In that time I've replaced my home mouse battery *3* times!! (The 3rd being yet again today.) My daughter has also gone through 2 batteries in her mouse as well (though she spends most of her time on her laptop with the touchpad).The shipping was fast and you get several batteries for a low cost, but I think a more economical way to go is to spend a little extra on name brand dependable batteries that last 2-3 times as long.

They are ok - I haven't had any arrive DOA, but they really don't seem to work for very long. In an Xbox One controller, they last about half the time that a set of duracells would. I don't think they're terrible, but I doubt I'll buy them again. You can frequently catch Duracells on Newegg at about 30 per 100. Yes, it's a bit more than the amazon basics per battery, but you'll get a lot more usage out of each pair.

They didn't last very long in my cheap camera. With them not being lithium I didn't expect them to last forever, but I should of gotten more then a days use out of them.

They were duds. I bought them before christmas so I could stick them in the toys and not one worked. I tried them on other items to make sure it wasn't the toys and not the batteries . Nope , it was all of the batteries. I only give one star for the reason I got them on time ....now I have a box of triple a batteries that don't work . so glad I caught that before christmas or I would have had disappointed children on christmas.

They're the same size as the batteries they replaced. Who knows if they last longer, have more power than others until they go dead Who remembers to come back and post that these batteries worked for one day more or less than the last set you had They're batteries, and they looked like they were cheap to me.

This a really cute kit which would make for a great gift for someone. It is in a little leather like pouch and has everything you need to give yourself a quality manicure. The nail clipper is a perfect size and works just as well on a women or man's nails. The file is nice as well (although I still prefer to use emory boards on mine). I actually bought another one of these to give to my son as a stocking stuffer this last Christmas for him to use at college. Just a nice, quality made kit at a reasonable price.

This are super colorful great gift giving holiday bags and tags. I always give smaller gifts to neighbors (sometimes home made baked goods, sometimes a bottle of wine). These bags are perfect for this. The drawstring is made of ribbon and seals the bag well. These would also be great for packaging teacher's gifts or for family gifting. Highly recommend.

This bag does not fit my 17-inch laptop, although mine is a little bigger than many. You would need a relatively thin 17-inch laptop to make this work. Also, as some other reviewers described, it has a cheap-feeling inner lining. I also do not like that the zippers for the main pocket do not extend toward the base farther, so this does not open as wide as I would like. It will get the job done and serves as a replacement for my previous backpack, which was falling apart, but I do not think I would really recommend it to anyone.

This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money.

This is a good tablet for children and adults too. However there is an issue with the port and charger cable. We did not even have this tablet 3 weeks before it would barley charge. Took it back to best buy and they said they could not fox it, and imagine the port is not covered under the manufacturer warranty. So now I have a tablet that takes a couple days to charge. Its really frustrating.

This is a great hair straightener. Heats up quickly and evenly, makes it easy to take the curl out of my naturally wavy hair. It fits easily in my hand and maneuvers around the front and back of my head easily. Does not heat up my countertop (keeps the heat on the iron). I love this pink, too, it matches my decor perfectly.

This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case.

This is my new favorite daily vitamin. Totally Vegan, easy to swallow and fills all the daily requirements of my 60+aged body. I have a tendency to skip breakfast most days a week and this vitamin agrees with an empty stomach (no aftertaste, burping, or unpleasant stomach rumblings). This is a lot cheaper than my usual Centrum formula so Amazon has once again turned me away from name brands and over to their store brand names. I highly recommend for any woman over age 40 who cares about their health!

This is my second Kindle and I am really enjoying it. I purchased mainly to use as a reader but it has exceeded my expectations. I can check my emails, surf the web, down loaded fb and pintrest as well. I have linked to my local library and can borrow books with ease. I have also downloaded Netflix as well. I love that I can change it to night reading so there is not so much of a strain on my eyes. I have not charged it for 2days now and have done quite a bit of reading and still showing 53%after 2 days. I purchased the 16g but plan on purchasing a micro SD card so I can expand the memory to download audio books as well.

This is my second time purchasing these Amazon AA batteries, the first purchase the batteries were great. I'm currently using them in LED lights for decoration and the first set I purchased would last burning 8 hours per day for a couple of weeks, however these new performance batteries noticeably dim after 3 or 4 days of burning.

This is perfect for my between salon visits. I have been using this now twice a week for over a month and I absolutely love it! My skin looks amazing and feels super smooth and silky. This is also super easy to use (just follow instructions). I can see already that I will begin expanding the time between visits which will definitely help me save money in the long run. Highly recommend!

This is the first Amazon product I've purchased. I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money. I would rather use batteries that cost 15-20 more and last twice as long.

This Jinri hair dryer is among one of the best I have ever owned. Strong and powerful, my hair dries super quick. It has varying speeds and heat levels which allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time. It also fits well in my hand, is relatively light weight, and I can maneuver from the front to back of my head easily. I love this red color as well and it matches my decor perfectly. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new, quality hair dryer at a reasonable price.

This kindle is awesome. I love the design of it. Nothing software wise that was different than my other kindle but the way it's designed makes it much more comfortable and easier to read. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the price. If it were cheaper, this kindle would have been five stars no doubt.

This pill travel organizer is too cute! I love it! I only take 1 prescription pill, but I do take an assortment of vitamins and supplements. The slots in the primary case are large enough for the larger sized vitamins/supplements. It's geared for 7 days, and there are morning slots and evening ones. Technically, you could use this for 2 weeks if you combined your am/pm pills. The compartments open and close easily. The pill box fits nicely in the carrying case. Did I mention that it's really cute?? It also comes with a smaller pill case too. I've use one like this for overnight or weekend trips. The compartments can hold my large fish oil capsule! I keep my small case filled with one or two of my prescription tablets and then keep it in my purse. Then if I realize that I forgot to take it one day or if I forget to bring it with me when I go out of town, I'm alright.

This spray smells amazing, it does claim to be completely natural so I am wondering if it really is since the smell is very well... processed in my opinion, that being said, it does look completely natural it's completely transparent and once you apply it it doesn't feel as sticky as other products I've used before it really gives the hair a very natural look and for having just applied it a few minutes ago my hair feels extremely soft to the touch which gives me a pretty good idea that this is a good hair spray. The presentation is really pretty and looks cute and clean as well. I love it! I just hope it works well in the long run! The only problem I had (completely unrelated to the spray itself) is that they left it at my neighbors door instead.

The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong.

To be honest, I rarely have used an overnight cream. Typically, my skin care routine is the same morning and night (wash, apply hyalauronic serum, and some kind of moistutrizer). So, when I saw this Iryasa cream I wanted to try it. Easy to apply, you can immediately feel the moisture starting to work. I do apply this about 30 minutes before I actually go to sleep to allow it time to be absorbed (before putting my face on my pillow) as it is a thicker type of cream and needs time. My skin in the morning feels better than ever. Soft and supple, I definitely feel a difference after using this for over 2 weeks now. I highly recommend this cream for women and men.

Very disappointed with these batteries. I was using them in a wall clock. The clock repeatedly did not work after a new battery was put in. I figured the clock was no good, since the batteries were new. Bought a new clock, same thing happened. Decided to test the batteries prior to installation. I found that of the twenty batteries I tested, only 2 tested good. So therefore, my first clock probably wasn't bad in the first place, the batteries are faulty. I still have 12 batteries left to test, but I not hopeful that these will be any better.

Very functional for a tablet and e-reader. This was a purchase for my stepmom who broke her previous Kindle. She likes it because the screen is big, ease of use, and you can access the internet. The kids side is good too for the kids but some of the apps like YouTube and YouTube Kids will not play on this because it's an Amazon operating system. Overall I would recommend this to people who like the regular e-readers and want a tablet.

Very good price for batteries, and they work flawlessly. Unfortunately, they don't come in their own Container to keep them together after opening. This means you need to have a small ziploc or something to store them in, or you are just going to have a bunch of loose batteries rolling around all over the place.

Very nice. Looks just as pictured. I put a yarn project keeper, some yarn and a couple other small items without trouble. The measurements given were active. The ribbon is lovely, thick satin ribbon and is white. Plenty of it with lots of tail after closing the top. The material of the bag is thin, but effective - I can't see through it. I would buy again. It's a lovely, reusable gift bag. It arrived quickly (I have prime) and in great shape along with other items I ordered.

Very sturdy and well made. My AirPods fit snugly into the case and the cases latching button is magnetic and closes easily and is very secure. The charging light is visible as there is an opening for it built into the case so you can see when it is light up red or green and the charging port is accessible so you don’t have to remove them to charge them. They clasp onto my purse sturdily and I have no worries about them becoming dislodged from my purse and getting lost. If you want to use a different clasp it’s interchangeable with one of your choosing of the same size. Great quality for a great price. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

We purchased this tablet for our 5 y ear old since all the other kid-friendly tablets were limited it what they had on them. Something should be changed regarding the port for the charger. The little area with the small bar in it keeps bending to the point, 5 months later it broke off and of course the warranty has ended. I am over tablets. If you can buy it on black Friday for 25.00 bucks or less, it should be that price all year long. So now he has no tablet because I am not sending it out to have someone else's sent back to me..re-furbished. I am very disappointed.

What's happened to batteries Duracell use to be the gold standard, until we had over 10 of them fail by leaking and destroying expensive medical equipment year after year. Costco batteries became our go-to batteries until last year 2015 when they started leaking, even on the shelf. Tried Eveready but price and quality varies as well. I trusted Amazon and love the price, packaging, convenience and no leaks. But they don't last half the time the others have. Some of the top reviews have stated the electrical case very, very well. And yes, we have some high current draw uses. But as my staff and Doctors have said to me: They're just batteries! Get us some decent batteries already! We go through dozens a week so price is going to matter but, paying top dollar still doesn't seem to save equipment or increase the usage time. It seems every manufacture is changing their product for cost and marketing so that you have to be an expert to properly match basic AA batteries to your specific use. Not cool!!

When i purchased 2 if them i assumwd it would be kid friendly. Its fill with tons of bloat wear. The opening screen has about 15 -20 apps. It worse than a normal adult tablet. my kids dont use it at all because we have to unlock it for them everytime then open the kids app. Then we have to hover over them to help them ever step of the way.

When it works it's great but for some reason it doesn't always answer me When it doesn't answer me I turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn't work at that time. It was easy to set up with the phone app. Doesn't seem to matter where the phone is when it isn't working. I've tried close and far and in between. So a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn't

When my husband and I bought our Kindle Fire 8, we went to Best Buy and asked questions as best we could. There are programs we apparently need to put create and edit documents and spreadsheets!! We did ask if it had those features and was told yes but I think we need to have a special app. Why isn't there a manual or step by step guide on getting the most use out of Kindle Fire 8. Can I get it online? Kindle Fire 8 fun to use but needs more info for customers. Can we go to a class at Best Buy? Thanks for any help.

When this item is charged it works great, but it takes too long to charge. Asking my 3 year old to wait about 3 hours (no exaggerating) is a bit much. We have tried to buy a new charger and it still takes just as long. My niece has this same tablet and it take about 45 minutes to charge once it is fully dead

When you buy bulk batteries normally you open a box and have a bunch of batteries. With amazons frustration free packaging you open a cardboard box and find pain, hardship and loathing. I sprained a wrist trying to get the batteries out of the individual 4 pack space age metal plastic wrapping. It's terrible. It's also the first amazon product I didn't like. The first terribly packaged amazon product I've ever seen.

While this didnt seat on my walker bars well, it worked great for picking things up.I got the 26 inch one because the 36 in. one picked up good but it was a long reach to grab what I picked up. This one is perfect! It is a very sturdy piece of material especially the grabbing fingers. There is a rubber coating so what you pick up, doesnt slip out.

Worst batteries I ever bought. Less than one hour after installing in remote, popup on tv said remote battery low. Left them in and got about four hours more use before it wouldn't turn on the receiver. The AA's I bought seem to be fine. Not sure why the AAA's didn't last. Put 4 new ones in the remote ... we'll see how these do. The second set of four were no better than the first. Low battery warning after a few hours use (surfing dish tv program guide). All showed just over 1.5 volts before installation. Checked again when first low battery warning came up. Down to .8 volts. Guess I got an old, bad batch. Nothing but Duracell from here on out. Would not recommend these batteries !

Worst performance in AA alkaline batteries we have ever seen. We bought these for use in our manufacturing company, and we used them in a wide variety of applications. Everyone has had poor performance. For clocks that used to have batteries last three years, this brand lasted only several weeks. Same problems when used in a computer mouse by several people, laser pointers, and other applications. We are going back to name-brand AA batteries. This is the worst rating I have given any product in a long time.

Would not buy these again. I reluctantly gave it a 2nd star because the price was good, but the batteries are pretty much 1 star. These get pretty good reviews so I was excited about them. Then the kids kept coming back WAY TOO FAST asking for batteries for their Wii remote. It didn't make sense to me until I tossed some in my blood pressure monitor. That thing runs for many months or years on a set of batteries, but not these! Only weeks with these. I don't have any kind of meter or anything like that to check them, but the proof is in the usage.......it's awful. Buy something else with a brand name.

You'll pay $10 more for these anywhere else. I was initially leery of buying another SD card on amazon. 4 years ago I did so, and the card was a fake (said it had 32 gigs when plugged into the computer, but you could only load about 11 onto it, and it would say &#34;full.&#34; Apparently there's a way to fool your computer into thinking there's more space than there is, and this is what the fake/counterfeit cards will do).Not so with this one. It's the real deal, genuine SanDisk, and contains as many GB as it says it does. I'm a very pleased customer.

It is not a good value considering everything they give you is worth $5. Seriously. I’ve subscribed to some pretty nice STEM boxes and this is not impressive. Save your money. In fact, I’m not sure who wrote the other reviews because it’s not a good value. I tried it for two months and will not be fooled a third time.

Excellence treats and good value. I just wish they would send varieties in pairs not threes as I have two dogs.<br /><br />UPDATE: I had to return the remainder of the box. Both my terriers who usually can eat most anything got severe diarrhea.<br /><br />The have never reacted to other brands of bully sticks like this before so I think something is definitely wrong with this product.

The toys were generally designed to appeal to people. For a cat just about any shape filled with crinkly sounding paper is the same whether it has a snowflake on it or a strawberry. My dog loves them, though, and likes to tear them up. It just depends on what your cat's interest is. Mine turned up their noses at the toothpaste-like tube of treats. But your cat may like it.

UPDATE November, 2019:<br />I think it's time to put my money into a different subscription. Each month, there are fewer and fewer full and ""deluxe sample"" size products. Those that are full size aren't worth much money. There's no point of me putting my money into so many samples.<br /><br />OVERVIEW:<br />I just received my first Cocotique box. I was a little nervous, as I'm new to subscription boxes, but I'm actually quite satisfied with the products. Most of them are full-size, and others are large enough to get quite a few uses out of. The month's box (the actual cardboard box the products are in) is absolutely beautiful! Included is a card with extensive information about all of the products, including prices and where to find them should you decide to purchase them. I absolutely love that they included this because I can easily find the products if I want to order them, and I can see the value of the products versus the cost of the box ($25/month).<br /><br />PRODUCTS:<br />With that being said, the value of the products in the box is well worth the cost of the subscription (in this box, at least). The price of the products come up to about double the cost of the box (approximately $47). So, I'm happy with the value. You get more than 2 or 3 items, and they're pretty large.<br /><br />CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT:<br />One item (eyeshadow) was broken (still sealed). I emailed them on a Saturday and they responded within 2 or 3 hours to apologize and let me know that a replacement was on the way. I greatly appreciate the quick and polite customer service.<br /><br />SHIPPING:<br />Shipping was EXTRA fast, but...things are not safely secured in the box. I'm not sure if this is how the eyeshadow box was broken or not, but the products definitely need to be better secured. The products are packaged with pretty crinkled paper, but not enough to hold the products in place. Some products are heavier than others, which may cause some issues in some boxes. This is reason for the 4-star review. All of the products were strewn throughout the box in an unorganized way. Unfortunately, mail carriers don't (and sometimes can't) always take the time to ensure that things aren't thrown around during shipping, so more secure packaging may make things a little better.<br /><br />BILLING:<br />I have to be honest and say that the way they do their billing is a bit...odd to me. They bill on your anniversary date, even if the box isn't due to be shipped for weeks. I signed up in early to mid-March, and I just received my first box, the April box. This, of course, depends when you sign up, but when you initially sign up determines if you receive your first box for the CURRENT month or the month after. I was just now charged for next month's box, even though I just received this month's (April) box today. Again, I'm fairly new to subscription boxes and the other ones that I'm subscribed to charge on your anniversary and send your box when you're charged. YES, this is stated in multiple places on Cocotique's website and other places, so I was aware of it, but again, it's just a bit odd to me because it seems like you're waiting for a very long time for something you've paid for. But, that's the way they work and I'll more than happily deal with it to see what they have in store.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />I will be continuing my subscription. I'm fairly new to the makeup world, so being able to try a wide variety of products (again, these products are large, so you can do a lot more than ""try"" them) without having to buy all of them one-by-one comes in handy. It saves both money and time. I've definitely told my friends about this subscription box, and I'm excited to see what will be in future boxes. I think I'll be ordering some of the past boxes, also.<br /><br />As time goes by and I receive more boxes, I'll update my review.

I got this from Annie and the clay is not worth the money I even tried mixing with cosclay and premo and it still would break on test I baked an 45 mins because everyone knows 15 mins isn’t enough to have strong jewelry. The glue they send is never usable I have gotten theee tubes it’s always junk . I tried for four months hoping things would change yes there is great stuff in boxes but the polymer it’s self is useless unless your gonna use it for sculpting or something else . To me it’s compatible to Amazon clay sorry Annie’s I want be getting anymore

I would say this is an okay purchase, we received our first box a week ago , my son is 4 and was not impressed by anything that came in the box, the age says 4-8 but I could foresee the toys being for an older kid as like collectables or something. we are going to wait until the November box comes before deciding whether or not to continue it monthly or cancel it.

When I first signed up for the box it was great. Since the upgrade everything has gone down hill. The box itself changed to a cheap cardboard box rather than the study lift of top box that was used originally.<br />You would think that with the price increase the items would be better or at least more of them. The quality of items have decreased, I have yet to get the 3 full size items in every box. I will get 1-2 full size and the 3rd that they consider full size is the minimal full/trial size that they sell or the face mask they consider full size. you get less items for the increase as well.<br />If it does not get any better i will be cancelling the subscription.

I thought this would be a nice gift for my wife for the year. It would have been if we ever got anything other than the first months box (which was nice). However, without any warning or notification, they stopped it. Now it’s not even available. So I switched to a different subscription box.

These items might be for little little kids (6-10) who think any super hero is cool, but teenagers might not enjoy half the contents. I bought it for Christmas figuring I would get 2 boxes between now and then. The communication with the seller wasn't the best and I got a very generic answer. The box wasn't even in another box hiding what it was so had my son walked out the door his gift would have been ruined among other possibilities with strangers in my building who may have seen it sitting there before I did. I knew purchasing the box the shirt wouldn't fit my son so I'm not basing any of the review on that and can't say what material it was. The other items were a thin blanket or beach towel depending what you want to use it for, a key chain, a light up button, a small pillow (a toddler could carry or put their little head on), a small tote bag, and a figure in a box. That was it. Not any character I'm familiar with and I am a fan so it was disappointing thinking I was going to have a gift with a bunch of items not found in store and honestly I don't think he will like or use any of these items at all.

I DID ENJOY THE ADVENTURE OF THE BOX AND BEING INTRODUCED TO NEW THINGS. BUT THE SNACKS THEMSELVES WERE JUST OK. THERE WERE TOO MAY THINGS THAT WERE SIMILAR FOR THE MONTH OF JULY, LIKE TOO MANY TYPES OF WHORCHEWTISHIRE RICE CRACKERS. A COUPLE OF THOSE WOULD HAVE SUFFICED. THE HAND MADE FIZZING CANDIES WERE INTERESTING AND THE STRAWBERRY MOUSSE LAYERED WAFFLE COOKIES IN THE SHAPE OF A FISH WERE EXCELLENT. I WANTED MORE DESCRIPTION ON THE INFORMATIONAL POSTCARD, LIKE WHY WERE THESE ITEMS PICKED?? I DID NOT RECOGNIZE A THEME.

Subscribed & received 1st box for Small Breeds. The description states you receive a ‘Box Full’ of treats suitable for small dogs. The box contained 7 treats. 7 treats is hardly a ‘Box Full’! I have no problem paying for quality treats but IMO this box is grossly overpriced at $25. (Thankfully the first box is half price!) Also, the treats were much too large & hard for my 2 small breed dogs. (7 lb Chihuahua & 12 lb Chiweenie) The quality of the treats seemed fine but due to the amount & size of treats, I cancelled my subscription.

I bought this laptop to replace my older macbook air. I'm shocked at how slow it is. I never had the spinning on my other one that I have on this one. I don't get it. I'm tempted to return it for a different macbook. I got a macbook because I hated how slow windows is. this is still faster than windows, but it acts like windows when you need to update it. This macbook is up to date so I don't know why it's acting like a windows computer. VERY DISAPPOINTED!<br /><br />Is there an update. I get more frustrated with this laptop than any windows I have ever had. My old macbook air, smoked this one. I never got booted off of wifi with my old one. I sure hope they have an update that fixes this issue. I told my friends to hold off on purchasing a new macbook air because no one has time for the spinning and getting booted off that happens constantly.<br /><br />I do not recommend unless they have an update to fix the problem.

I can't say I am pleased with this router. It does not handle multiple devices as well as my old 5 year old apple router. I need to restart both modem and this router frequently. Perhaps I got a dud (reviews suggest this happens). It also does not handle interference from other items in the house using electrical current--when my AC kicks on, this router bogs down immediately. When I get a chance, I'll buy a 50' ethernet cord and extension cord and move this router around the house to try and find a better location. But, I should'nt have to do that w a router that costs upwards of $150…

I opened one black cartridge, and it didn't print at all, even after numerous attempts to print and align the cartridges. I then opened the second black cartridge and found that black ink was leaking out around the print head. I am certainly not placing this in my printer to leak all over the inside of it. I don't know about the color cartridge because I'm not even going to open it. I tried to return these cartridges but found the time limit for returning is passed. I order my cartridges whenever I put in the last one I have on hand -- how do I know how long until I'll need another one?!? I didn't realize there was a time limit for returns but here I am one day past the time limit so I'm out the $. Guess I've learned my lesson. Here I sit with no cartridge for my printer, in the middle of projects. Don't depend on these refurbed cartridges!!!

Lorex LW2702 7-Inch LCD Quad Digital Wireless Surveillance System. Bought this surveillance system a week ago for $299.99. Installed it and it wasn't recording or picking up movement all the time, and it is not in color, more like black and white, the screensaver is in color. A couple of days later it rained (installed it on our garage) and both cameras quick working right, one filled up with water and the other the alarm kept going off with nothing in sight. called Lorex and all they said was, we should have had it under cover, which is not mentioned in instructions. These are the rudest customer service people ever, don't expect help from them. We were told to pay to ship it back and if they didn't think it was our fault. they would then decide to replace it. Lorex needs to get their customer service back in the US. If anyone asks I would NOT recommend buying anything from this company.

So I have mixed feelings-<br />Go by the size chart they have, not by the measurements.<br />I have the old MacBook Pro (Late 2013 Version) and was going to buy the 14-15 inch because by all other measurements my laptop should fit in that.<br />I ordered the 15.4 Inch in the black, and it BARELY fits. So if you have a durable case on it, and don't want to have to spend time getting it inside the case, I recommend upping to the 15.6 inch.<br />Now that all said- the material feels very cheap, and there's no real ""shape"" to the case. It looks like there would be almost a frame inside the charger holder as well as the main part of the laptop case and that's simply not the case. The zippers also stick a lot, whether it's full or empty.<br />It would be nice to see the ""younger"" color options were available in the larger cases. But, overall it's a good enough case that I won't return it. Just be aware when you spend $20 for a laptop carrying case on Amazon, it's likely that quality will be subpar.<br />It will work for what I need it to (which is to keep my tote organized for college classes)-but overall I feel like the quality and structure of the case could be greatly improved.

Maybe it's just me as an older guy, but I really wasn't expecting this. Unlike ANY remote I've ever used. NO control over TV volume, mute, 'back', numbers for channel, etc. Nope, this thing (streaming) is NOT intuitive to use, freezes, pixelates, is slow to change channels, and is a pain to use. &#34;Alexa&#34; has more of &#34;I cannot do that for_____ reason&#34; than it has use. Alexa listens to me about as well as an old deaf dog! Useless 80% of the time. If I'd have known all this I would have probably gone with an antenna and free, over-the-air TV viewing. I hate this thing and &#34;help&#34; is a matter of luck with no humans involved. I have to have my 16 y.o. grandson help with some things. Get ready to carry a bunch of remotes and such (Fire control, TV remote and cordless phone if you carry that around). I really, really don't like this POS!

Filming mode is too dark. I am vision impaired. I can't always get subtitles, and when I do they are so small I can't read them. Little hand control is too hard to use without a flash light. Should be back-lit to be effective. I am anxious to watch what's on offer, but it's so frustrating I can't stay with it for long. Too bad. I was really looking forward to Prime Videos and Movies. I am nearly 84 years old.

When I installed this RAM (by itself) in my PC, I could not get it to run at 3600 MHz at CL16 (even with XMP enabled). It was getting speeds of CL18-22-22-42. I've attached a screenshot of CPU-Z showing the timings. I tinkered with the RAM, my BIOS, etc. for several hours and could not get it to run at CL16, which is unfortunate. The best I could get was CL18. When I installed this RAM alongside my existing CL16, RAM, it reduced the speed of my memory for 1066 MHz.<br /><br />I would not recommend this RAM.

I've been using my iPhone as a webcam and I thought this light would be a clean way to mount my phone and light my face. For context, the light and my phone are just above my monitor (i.e., looking down at me). Unfortunately, the ""strengthened holder"" (which is holding my iPhone) begins to droop after a while, and that in-turn drags the light with it. I have tried tightening the various joints and repositioning the light, but inevitably it droops again.<br /><br />If I had the light directly in front of me, and not angled down, I think it might work better, but that is not possible given my desk setup. I'd pass on this.

UPDATE (from 5 stars to 2 stars): JAN 2023: One of the HDMI ports stopped working, so now this thing has become pretty useless to me. If it had continued working, this would have been great. But unfortunately it randomly stopped working one day and it hasn't worked since.<br /><br />This little thing has been wonderful. I have a 2018 MacBook Pro (Intel, not M1/M2) and I was looking for a dock that would allow me to use 2 separate monitors with the laptop lid closed, and this one is perfect.<br /><br />It is pretty small (5"" x 2"" x 0.5"", smaller than a Pro Max iPhone) and has a premium metal (?) feel to it (all I know is that it isn't plastic). All you need to do is plug it into the MBP and it works from there (side note: you need to install a quick driver before using the dock, but it's very simple)<br /><br />I appreciate that it allows for pass through charging (which also ensures that high-energy USB devices receive ample power). Additionally, it is really nice that this has both DisplayPort AND HDMI, which is not common based on what I've seen.<br /><br />My only gripe with this is that there are only 2x USB ports (which I knew when I bought it). If you're looking for an easy to use Thunderbolt dock for your MacBook Pro, get this one.

I am quite disappointed in this dock. It had lots of positive reviews, but for my Intel (not M1/M2) Macbook Pro (2018), it only lets you output to 1 unique monitor (if you have more than 1 monitor plugged in, they will all show the same thing), even if your laptop lid is closed.<br /><br />The description said that for M1/M2 Macs, all the external monitors would show the same thing. But this is apparently the case for Intel Macs as well.<br /><br />Would NOT recommend if you have an Intel Mac and want to use 2 unique external monitors.

Its was a nice looking keyboard and easy to store. But when you use it the keys dint work that well. They either dont work or they double the letter your pushing. Would not recommend. I am now having to order another one that is not flexible.
